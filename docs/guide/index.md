# Getting Started

## Why Martyrs?

In Greek mythology, Martyrs is a Titan god of fire. Martyrs is best known for defying the gods by stealing fire from them and giving it to humanity in the form of technology, knowledge, and more generally, civilization. So our goal is to provide people with the best technologies and solutions that they can easily use every day.

## Motivation

Why create another UI framework when there are a huge number of solutions that have been developed and supported for a long time, with a large community?

### Martyrs managed by OZ DAO

There are several reasons for this. The main reason is that Martyrs was created for OZ DAO initiatives. The development process of the framework directly depends on the needs of the DAO, and using other solutions, we would not be able to integrate the voting system into the development roadmap.

### Easy to restyle and redefine

Another important reason is the complexity of configuring styles for existing frameworks. Recently, styleless solutions have begun to appear and we support this. We will strive for complete autonomy of each component.

### WEB3 and UX oriented

The third reason is the focus of the framework on WEB3 and UX. Our goal is to make it easy not only to develop, but also to use components by users. The framework was created by designers for designers and, in addition to performance, sets cosmetic and usability goals for itself.
