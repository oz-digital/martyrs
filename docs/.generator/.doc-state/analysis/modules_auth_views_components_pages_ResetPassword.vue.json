      },
      {
        "name": "Field",
        "responsibility": "Generic input component used here for email, bound via v-model:field to auth.state.user.email with validation."
      },
      {
        "name": "Button",
        "responsibility": "Submit button that triggers onSubmit and then redirectTo on successful reset-password initiation."

      "Error handling in onSubmit rethrows a generic Error and logs failures; could be improved with user feedback.",
      "Input validation uses a common inputsValidation.validateInputs helper with hardcoded Russian error messages.",
      "Slide-fade CSS transitions are defined locally to animate tab content changes."
