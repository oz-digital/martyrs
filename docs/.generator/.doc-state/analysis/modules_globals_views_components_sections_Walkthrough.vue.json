  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Walkthrough.vue is a full-screen onboarding slider that presents a series of introductory slides, culminating in a final call-to-action slide offering Sign Up, Sign In, or Continue as Guest. It uses Embla Carousel for slide mechanics and Capacitor Preferences to record that the user has completed the walkthrough.",
    "Purpose": "To guide new users through key app features on first launch and then route them to Sign Up / Sign In or let them continue as guests, while persisting a flag so the walkthrough does not reappear.",
