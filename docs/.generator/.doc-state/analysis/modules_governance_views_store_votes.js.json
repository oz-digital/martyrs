    "Summary": "This file defines a reactive Vue store for managing votings. It maintains state for all votings and the current voting, exposes asynchronous actions for CRUD operations, starting/ending votes and fetching results from the backend API, and records a history of state changes.",
    "Purpose": "To centralize and encapsulate all voting-related data and operations in a single store, allowing Vue components in the governance module to read voting state and dispatch actions without duplicating API logic.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "votingsState",
        "type": "reactive object",
        "responsibilities": "Holds the list of all votings (`all`) and the currently selected voting (`current`), including metadata like title, description, dates and status."
      },
      {
        "name": "votingsActions",
        "type": "object",
        "responsibilities": "Provides methods to perform asynchronous API calls for fetching, creating, updating, deleting, starting, ending votings and retrieving results. On errors it delegates to the global error handler."
      },
      {
        "name": "votingsHistory",
        "type": "Array",
        "responsibilities": "Stores deep-cloned snapshots of the voting state on every change, primarily for debugging or time-travel inspection."

      }
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported into Vue components or other stores as: `import { votingsState, votingsActions } from 'modules/governance/views/store/votes.js'`. Components read from `votingsState` and invoke `votingsActions` to trigger API calls and mutate the store.",
    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "A deep clone (via JSON.parse(JSON.stringify)) is used in the watcher to capture state history; this may grow unbounded if not pruned.",
      "All action methods funnel errors through the global `setError` handler before re-throwing, ensuring consistent error reporting.",
      "The `votingsHistory` array is not exported, so it currently serves internal debugging or future time-travel features.",
      "The store follows a simple pattern without a formal Vuex module, relying instead on Vue 3's Composition API."
