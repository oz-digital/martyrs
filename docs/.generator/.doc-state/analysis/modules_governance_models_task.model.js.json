    "Summary": "Defines and exports a Mongoose model for a Task entity with fields like title, description, status, assignee, due date, milestone, initiative, priority, and tags, along with timestamps and indexes.",
    "Purpose": "Provides the schema and model definition for tasks in the governance module, centralizing data structure, validation rules, and indexes for task documents in MongoDB.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "TaskSchema",
        "type": "Mongoose.Schema",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Defines the structure of a Task document",
          "Sets field types, validation (required, enums), default values",
          "Configures timestamps with custom currentTime",
          "Declares indexes on milestone, assignedTo, status, and dueDate"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Task",
        "type": "Mongoose.Model",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Represents the Task collection",
          "Provides CRUD operations and query interface for Task documents"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "default export (model factory)",
        "signature": "db => Model<Task>",
        "description": "Accepts a db object with a mongoose instance, defines TaskSchema, attaches indexes, compiles and returns the Task model.",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "db",
            "type": "object",
            "description": "An object containing the mongoose instance (db.mongoose)"

        "returns": "Mongoose Model for Task"
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "db.mongoose (Mongoose)",
      "User model (ref)",
      "Milestone model (ref)",
      "Initiative model (ref)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported by passing the applicationâ€™s db object into the factory function, e.g.: `const Task = require('./task.model')(db);` Then used in services/controllers to create, read, update and delete task documents.",
    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "Timestamps use a custom currentTime function to generate `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields.",
      "Status and priority fields use enums to constrain values.",
      "Indexes are added on key query fields (milestone, assignedTo, status, dueDate) for performance.",
      "Tags field is an array of strings for flexible labeling."
