    "Usage": "Imported into parent Vue components or pages that render track listings. Used by providing a track object via the 'track' prop, for example:\n\nimport TrackCard from 'modules/music/components/cards/TrackCard.vue';\n\n<TrackCard :track=\"someTrackObject\" />",

      "Imports 'computed' from Vue but does not currently use itâ€”could be removed or used for reactive derived data.",
      "Applies hover transitions: play button fades in and scales on hover, background color darkens.",
      "Falls back to album.coverUrl or a placeholder image if no coverUrl is provided on the track object."
