        "name": "CardHeader",
        "description": "Renders the top section of the card showing the post title, date, creator, owner, and contextual actions."

    "Usage": "Imported into parent views or pages via `import CardBlogpost from '.../components/blocks/CardBlogpost.vue'` and used in templates as `<CardBlogpost :blogpost=\"item\" :user=\"currentUserId\" type=\"short\" />`. Variants controlled by props `type`, `hideTitle`, and `hideDescription`.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "The `type` prop toggles CSS classes and conditional rendering for 'short' preview, full 'blogpostPage', or default list view.",
      "Some elements (Chips, Image constructor) are commented out, suggesting potential future use or refactoring.",
      "Global `FILE_SERVER_URL` is used to prefix the image src; ensure it's defined in environment or runtime config.",
      "Edit action is conditionally passed to CardHeader if the logged-in user is the creator.",
      "The component relies on the structure of `blogpost.content` to extract media and text blocks."
