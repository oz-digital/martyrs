    "Usage": "Imported into a Backoffice layout or parent component to render the sidebar; other components do not directly import it but rely on its router navigation for view switching.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Props.favorites is defined but not utilized in the template or script logic.",
      "The sidebar style block is empty; styling is inherited from global utility classes (e.g., flex, pd-semi).",
      "menuItems and generalItems are static arrays; dynamic control (e.g., permissions filtering) would need to be added if required.",
      "Icons are rendered with <component :is=\"...\"> to allow conditional inclusion and consistent styling.",
      "No error handling or loading state is implemented in onMounted â€“ currently a placeholder."
