    "Summary": "This file serves as the entry point for the \"organizations\" feature module. It imports Vuex store modules, a Vue router definition, and a set of Vue components (pages, blocks, sections, elements). It defines and exports an initialization function that registers stores and routes, and it bundles all pieces into a default module object for the Martyrs application framework.",
    "Purpose": "To centralize and expose all organization-related stores, routes, and UI components, and to provide an initialize method for integrating the organizations module into the main application.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "ModuleOrganization",

    "Usage": "Import the default ModuleOrganization into the main application bootstrap. Call ModuleOrganization.initialize(app, store, router, options) to wire up routes and stores. Optionally, import individual components or store modules for more granular use.",
    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": "This module follows the Martyrs pattern: a self-contained feature bundle. The initialize function assumes that the app's store manager supports addStore(), and the router supports addRoute(). All UI components are grouped for both named and default exports, facilitating lazy loading or direct import."
