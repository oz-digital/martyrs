    "Usage": "Registered as a page component in the community module router. Mounted at a route that provides an optional `category` param and query filters (tags, period). Other parts of the app navigate to it or link to `/blog/:category?tags=...&period=...`.",
    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "The `<style>` block is present but emptyâ€”styling may be inherited or defined at a higher level.",
      "Commented-out code hints at a default category fallback and breadcrumb inclusion that could be enabled in future.",
      "Breadcrumbs is imported but not used in the template; consider removing or integrating it.",
      "Filter synchronization ensures deep-linkable and shareable URLs for blog post filtering."
