  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue 3 single-file component that fetches and displays the details of a single initiative (name, description, status) based on the route parameter `id`.",
    "Purpose": "Serves as the page-level view for a specific initiative within the governance module; retrieves initiative data on mount and renders it in the template.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "Initiative",
        "responsibilities": "On mount, reads the route parameter, dispatches a store action to load the initiative by ID, stores the result in a local `ref`, and renders the initiative details."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "onMounted",
        "purpose": "Vue lifecycle hook that runs after the component is mounted. It retrieves the `id` from the route, calls the store action to fetch initiative data, and assigns it to the `initiative` ref.",
        "parameters": []
      },
      {
        "name": "initiativesActions.getInitiativeById",
        "purpose": "Store action invoked to fetch data for a single initiative by its ID.",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "id",
            "type": "string | number",
            "description": "Identifier of the initiative to fetch."

    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, onMounted)",
      "vue-router (useRoute)",
      "../../store/initiatives (initiativesActions, initiativesState)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported as a route component in the governance router configuration, typically mapped to a path like `/initiatives/:id`.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "There is no explicit loading or error state handling; the UI remains empty until `initiative` is set.",
      "No `<style>` block is defined, so styling must be inherited or defined globally.",
      "Relies on the store module `initiatives` having a `current` state and `getInitiativeById` action."
