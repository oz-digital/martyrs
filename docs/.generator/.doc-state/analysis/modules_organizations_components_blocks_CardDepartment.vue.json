    "Usage": "Import and register the component in a parent view or another component, then use `<CardDepartment :department=\"deptObject\" :organization=\"orgId\" />` to render the department block.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Imports Spoiler and DepartmentSub but does not use them in the template—possibly leftover.",
      "Scoped style defines a `.subdepartmentsartment` class that is never applied; likely a typo or dead CSS.",
      "Props `department` and `organization` are both declared as Object; `organization` often used as an ID string/number.",
      "Inline click handlers push full paths rather than named routes for detail/profile navigation."
