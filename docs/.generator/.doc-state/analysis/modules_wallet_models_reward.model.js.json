  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Defines and registers a Mongoose model called “Reward” with a schema that tracks rewards assigned to users or organizations for specific targets (blog posts or orders), including an amount and a snapshot of related metrics.",
    "Purpose": "Provide the data model for storing reward records in MongoDB, including who received the reward, the type of reward, the associated target entity, the amount awarded, and a snapshot of relevant engagement metrics.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "default export",
        "type": "Factory Function",
        "responsibilities": "Accepts a `db` object (with a Mongoose instance), defines the Reward schema, and registers/returns the Mongoose model."
      },
      {
        "name": "RewardSchema",
        "type": "Mongoose Schema",
        "responsibilities": "Holds the structure and validation rules for reward documents, including dynamic population of references, required fields, and automatic timestamps."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "defaultExport",
        "parameters": [
          "db"
        ],
        "description": "Creates the RewardSchema on the passed-in `db.mongoose`, applies options (timestamps, strict mode), and returns the model."
      },
      {
        "name": "ref (user field)",
        "parameters": [],
        "description": "Dynamic ref resolver for the `user` field: returns 'User' or 'Organization' based on `this.owner.type`."
      },
      {
        "name": "ref (target field)",
        "parameters": [],
        "description": "Dynamic ref resolver for the `target` field: returns 'Blogpost' or 'Order' based on `this.owner.blogpost`."
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "db.mongoose.Schema",
      "db.mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId",
      "db.mongoose.model",
      "Date.now"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported by a model‐loader or dependency‐injection mechanism (e.g. `import rewardModel from './reward.model.js'; const Reward = rewardModel(db);`) so that the Reward model is available for querying and CRUD operations elsewhere in the application.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "The schema uses dynamic reference functions (`ref: () => { … }`) that rely on `this.owner`, but no `owner` field is explicitly defined—might be a typo or external plugin injecting `owner`.",
      "All numeric fields (`amount`, snapshot metrics) are stored as strings; consider normalizing to Number if arithmetic is needed.",
      "`strict: false` allows storing arbitrary extra fields on reward documents.",
      "Custom timestamps use a `currentTime` function to set `createdAt` and `updatedAt` to `Date.now()`."
