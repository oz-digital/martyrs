    "Summary": "Defines an abstract Webhook class that wires up an HTTP POST endpoint on an Express-style `app` instance, binding a handler method and optional middlewares.",
    "Purpose": "Acts as a base controller for creating webhook endpoints. Subclasses must implement the `handleWebhook` method to provide custom processing logic.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "Webhook",
        "type": "class",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Store references to application (`app`), database (`db`) and event observer (`observer`).",
          "Register a POST route on the given `path`, applying any provided middlewares and binding the handler method to the class instance.",
          "Declare an abstract `handleWebhook` method that must be overridden by subclasses."
        ]
      }

    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "constructor",

    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "An Express-style `app`/router with `post()`",
      "A database instance (`db`)",
      "An event observer/emitter (`observer`)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported via `import Webhook from 'modules/globals/controllers/classes/globals.webhook'`. Subclasses extend `Webhook`, implement `handleWebhook`, then instantiate with `(app, db, observer, path, this.handleWebhook, [middlewares])` to register the endpoint.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "No direct imports in this file; it relies on injected dependencies.",
      "Ensures `handlerMethod` is bound to the instance so `this` references work correctly.",
      "Throws an error if `handleWebhook` is not overridden, enforcing subclass implementation.",
      "Middleware array is spread so you can register multiple pre-processing steps."
