  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue 3 component that renders a single rent record as a styled card, showing status, total days, start/end dates, optional comment and an Edit button.",
    "Purpose": "To provide a reusable, self-contained UI block for displaying and editing individual rent entries in the Rents module.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "CardRent",
        "role": "Primary Vue component defined in this file; encapsulates template, logic and styles for a rent card."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "totalDays",
        "type": "computed",
        "description": "Calculates the total number of days between rent.startDate and rent.endDate.",
        "parameters": "none (reads props.rent.startDate and props.rent.endDate)"
      },
      {
        "name": "formatDate",
        "type": "plain function",
        "description": "Converts a date value into a localized date string.",
        "parameters": "date (String|Date) – the input date to format"
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (computed, defineProps)",
      "vue-router (this.$router.push)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Import and register in a parent view or list component. Example:\n\nimport CardRent from '@/modules/rents/views/components/blocks/CardRent.vue';\n\n<template>\n  <CardRent :rent=\"rentItem\" />\n</template>",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses the <script setup> SFC syntax introduced in Vue 3 for concise component declarations.",
      "SCSS styles scoped via class selectors; follows simple BEM-like naming.",
      "Relies on browser locale for date formatting – may need adjustment for consistent cross-locale behavior.",
      "Does not emit events; navigation is handled internally via router push to an 'Edit Rent' named route."
