  "type": "source",
  "name": "Breadcrumbs.vue",
  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue component that generates and renders a dynamic breadcrumb navigation based on the current route and its metadata. It displays a home icon for the root, localized titles, links for intermediate segments, and highlights the current page.",
    "Purpose": "To provide a consistent, localized breadcrumb trail across the application, reflecting the user's current position in the route hierarchy and allowing easy navigation back to parent pages.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "Breadcrumbs",
        "type": "Vue SFC",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Compute an ordered list of breadcrumb items from the current route.",
          "Render each breadcrumb item with appropriate links or plain text.",
          "Display SVG icons (home and chevron) to separate segments visually."
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "router-link",
        "type": "Vue Router component",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Render clickable links for all but the last breadcrumb segment.",
          "Use the `to` prop to navigate to the correct path."
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "createRoute",
        "purpose": "Reconstruct a route path string by replacing dynamic segments (e.g. `:id`) with actual values from the current route's params.",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "array",
            "type": "string[]",
            "description": "An array of path segments (split by '/')."
          },
          {
            "name": "route",
            "type": "RouteLocationNormalized",
            "description": "The current Vue Router route object, used to read `route.params`."
          }
        ],
        "returns": "string – The joined path with parameters substituted."
      },
      {
        "name": "updateBreadcrumbs",
        "purpose": "Builds the `breadcrumbs` reactive array by mapping over `route.matched`, extracting localized titles, computing full paths, and filtering out hidden entries.",
        "parameters": [],
        "returns": "void – Updates the `breadcrumbs` ref in place."
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, watch)",
      "vue-router (useRoute, router-link)",
      "vue-i18n (useI18n, t, locale)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Import and include `<Breadcrumbs />` in a layout or page component. The component automatically watches the router state and updates whenever the route changes.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses route meta fields `meta.title` (an object keyed by locale) and `meta.breadcrumbs.hidden` to determine visibility and label.",
      "Applies a special CSS class (`t-main`) to the last breadcrumb item to indicate the current page.",
      "SCSS styling assumes a utility CSS system for flex layout and spacing (e.g. `flex-row`, `flex-v-center`).",
      "The home icon is rendered as an inline SVG only for the first breadcrumb entry.",
      "The component runs `updateBreadcrumbs` immediately on mount via `watch(..., { immediate: true })`."
    ]
