    "Summary": "This Vue component renders and manages a playlist creation form. It collects playlist title, description, privacy setting, and cover image, performs simple validation, submits data via a store action, and emits events on success or cancellation.",
    "Purpose": "To provide a reusable UI form for creating new music playlists in the 'music' module of the application.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "Field",
        "responsibility": "Renders a text or textarea input with built-in validation feedback."
      },
      {
        "name": "Radio",
        "responsibility": "Renders a radio button for selecting privacy (public/private)."
      },
      {
        "name": "Button",
        "responsibility": "Renders actionable buttons (Cancel/Create) with loaders and success indicators."
      },
      {
        "name": "UploadImage",
        "responsibility": "Handles image selection and upload, binding the resulting URL to the form."
      },
      {
        "name": "Media",
        "responsibility": "Displays an image preview when a coverUrl is present."
      },
      {
        "name": "IconMusic",
        "responsibility": "Shows a placeholder icon when no cover image is selected."

    "Usage": "Imported into a parent view or route component where playlist creation is needed. Listens for 'created' to refresh state or navigate, and 'cancel' to close the form or reset UI.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses Vue 3 <script setup> and reactive state for form and validation errors.",
      "Only title field is validated; additional validation could be added for other fields.",
      "Default form properties include isCollaborative and tracks, though they are not currently exposed in the UI.",
      "CSS classes appear to rely on a global utility/CSS framework, no scoped <style> block present.",
      "Error handling on submission only logs to consoleâ€”could be enhanced with user feedback."
