    "Summary": "This file defines and exports a Vue Router route configuration object for the backoffice \"Pages\" section. It sets up the base path, metadata (including titles and sidebar components), and three child routes for listing pages, adding a new page, and editing an existing page.",
    "Purpose": "Serve as a router module in the martyrs backoffice, registering all URL patterns, metadata and component loaders for the \"Pages\" area of the application.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "pages",
        "type": "Route Configuration Object",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Defines the base path 'pages'",
          "Holds meta information (title and sidebar)",
          "Contains child route definitions"
        ]

      {
        "name": "Sidebar",
        "type": "Vue Component",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Main sidebar layout for the backoffice pages section",
          "Injected via route meta to render navigation"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "SidebarPages",
        "type": "Vue Component",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Sidebar layout used specifically on add/edit page routes",

        "name": "component resolver",
        "signature": "() => Promise<Component>",
        "description": "Dynamically imports the specified Vue component to enable code-splitting. All child routes use this pattern with webpackChunkName 'Pages'.",

    ],
    "Usage": "Imported into the main backoffice router index (e.g. router/index.js) and spread into the routes array to activate '/pages', '/pages/add', and '/pages/:url+' routes.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses Vue Router's dynamic import syntax for lazy loading and webpack chunk naming.",
      "Child route ':url+' uses a custom regex '+' to match one or more segments, enabling nested page URLs.",
      "Meta fields include i18n-ready title objects and sidebar component references for dynamic layout."
