  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue component that renders either an image or a video based on the file extension of the provided URL. It implements lazy loading via IntersectionObserver, displays a placeholder until the media is loaded, and handles load and playback errors.",
    "Purpose": "To provide a reusable media renderer that supports images and videos with built-in lazy loading, placeholders, autoplay options, and error handling in a standardized way.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "Media",
        "type": "Vue component",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Determine media type (image or video) by file extension",
          "Render the appropriate HTML element (<img> or <video>) with passed options",
          "Lazy-load media when it enters the viewport",
          "Show a loading placeholder until the media is ready",
          "Display error messages on load/playback failure"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "handleLoad",

        "name": "handleError",
        "description": "Handles errors during media loading or playback and updates the error state.",

          {
            "name": "err",
            "type": "Error",

        "params": []
      },
      {
        "name": "checkAndPlayVideo",
        "description": "Attaches onplaying, onpause, and onerror handlers to the video element to track play state and errors.",
        "params": []
      },
      {
        "name": "setupIntersectionObserver",
        "description": "Creates an IntersectionObserver that watches the media element, triggers loading/autoplay when visible, and disconnects after first intersection.",
        "params": []
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, computed, onMounted, onUnmounted, script setup API)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Import the component in other Vue files (e.g. `import Media from '@/components/Media/Media.vue'`) and use it in templates: `<Media url=\"/path/to/file.mp4\" :options=\"{ autoplay: true, loop: false }\" />`.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses the Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax.",
      "Supports lazy loading via IntersectionObserver for both images and videos.",
      "Provides default playback options (muted, loop, playsinline, preload).",
      "The helper `checkAndPlayVideo` is defined but never invoked â€” potential dead code.",
      "Scoped styles include fade-in transition and placeholder/error styling."
