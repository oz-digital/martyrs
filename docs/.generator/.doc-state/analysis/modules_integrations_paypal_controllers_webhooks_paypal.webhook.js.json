  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Defines a PayPal-specific webhook handler by extending a generic WebhookHandler base class and implementing logic for different PayPal event types.",
    "Purpose": "To process incoming PayPal webhook HTTP requests, route them by event type, and send an acknowledgment response.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "PayPalWebhookHandler",
        "type": "class",
        "extends": "WebhookHandler",
        "responsibility": "Override the generic handler to implement PayPal-specific event processing logic."
      }

    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "handleWebhook",
        "signature": "async handleWebhook(req, res)",
        "description": "Entry point for incoming webhook calls. Extracts the `event_type` from the request body, logs based on the event, and returns a 200 response.",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "req",
            "type": "object",
            "description": "Express request object, expects a JSON body with an `event_type` field."

    "Dependencies": [
      {
        "module": "./webhookHandler.js",
        "importedEntity": "WebhookHandler",
        "purpose": "Base class providing a standard interface or shared logic for all webhook handlers."
      }
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported (default export) into a router or controller setup. An instance is created and its `handleWebhook` method is registered as the Express route handler for PayPal webhook endpoints.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Currently only logs events; production code should include validation of the webhook signature and persistence or business logic.",
      "Handles only two event types: PAYMENT.SALE.COMPLETED and PAYMENT.SALE.DENIED; all other events are logged as unhandled.",
      "Relies on Express.js request/response conventions but does not import Express directly."
