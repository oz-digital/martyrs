  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue 3 component for an audio block in a page/post constructor. It either renders a playable <audio> element when `prop.content` is present or an Upload control to add a new audio URL.",
    "Purpose": "Provides an editable audio element for a rich-content editor. Users can upload or specify an audio source, and the component emits events to update the parent data model.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "Upload",
        "source": "@martyrs/src/components/Upload/Upload.vue",
        "responsibility": "Displays a file chooser for audio uploads, binds the uploaded URL via v-model:field, and emits `file-change` when a file is selected."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "updateBlock",
        "description": "Locally replaces an updated block in `post.value.content` array, finding it by identity and splicing in the new version.",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "updatedBlock",
            "type": "Object",
            "description": "The block object to find and replace in the global `post` store."
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "onComponentSave",
        "description": "Handler for the Upload component's file-change event. Saves the returned URL, emits `input` to update the v-model and `updateBlock` to notify the parent.",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "url",
            "type": "String",
            "description": "The URL of the uploaded or selected audio file."
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, defineProps, defineEmits)",
      "@martyrs/src/components/Upload/Upload.vue",
      "a global or injected `post` store (used in updateBlock, but not imported explicitly)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported and registered in a parent constructor or editor component. Typically used as `<Audio :prop=\"block\" v-model=\"block.content\" />`, where `block` is an object in the page/post content array.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "The internal `updateBlock` function references `post.value` but `post` is not defined or imported—likely relies on a global/injected store or is dead code.",
      "The `<source>` tag uses `type=\"video/mp4\"` for an audio file—this may be a typo (should be `audio/mpeg` or similar).",
      "`fileInput` ref is declared but never used.",
      "Placeholder text says 'Upload video' while the component handles audio."
