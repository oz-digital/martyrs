  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Defines a utility function that returns a MongoDB aggregation pipeline stage to add membership counts (subscribers and non-blocked members) to organization documents.",
    "Purpose": "To centralize and reuse the logic for computing the number of subscribers and active members in an organization's \"memberships\" array during aggregation queries.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "addMembersQuantity",
        "type": "function",
        "responsibility": "Generates an $addFields stage for a MongoDB aggregation pipeline that computes two new fields: numberOfSubscribers and numberOfMembers."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "addMembersQuantity",
        "description": "Accepts a user context (currently unused) and returns a MongoDB aggregation stage to calculate membership counts.",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "user",
            "type": "Object",
            "description": "A user object or context (not used in the current implementation)."
          }
        ],
        "returns": {
          "type": "Object",
          "description": "An aggregation pipeline stage object containing $addFields with two fields: numberOfSubscribers and numberOfMembers."
        }
      }

    "Dependencies": [
      {
        "module": "mongodb",
        "import": "ObjectId",
        "usage": "Imported but not used in this file."
      }
    ],
    "Usage": "Import the default export `addMembersQuantity` and include it in an aggregation pipeline. Example: `pipeline.push(addMembersQuantity(currentUser));`",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "The `user` parameter is declared but not currently utilizedâ€”could be removed or extended for role-based filtering.",
      "ObjectId is imported from mongodb but not used; can be safely removed unless future code needs it.",
      "Relies on MongoDB aggregation operators: $addFields, $filter, $size, $eq, $not, and $in.",
      "If `memberships` arrays are large, these filters may have performance implications."
