  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue single-file component that renders a full-page perspective grid background with continuously animated grid lines using purely CSS/SCSS.",
    "Purpose": "Provides a decorative animated grid effect for landing pages or any section that needs a dynamic background in the Martyrs project.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "AnimatedGrid",
        "type": "Vue component",
        "responsibility": "Renders the grid container and the animated grid lines."
      },
      {
        "name": "grid (CSS class)",
        "type": "SCSS class",
        "responsibility": "Sets up 3D perspective and a cover-sized background area for the grid."
      },
      {
        "name": "grid-lines (CSS class)",
        "type": "SCSS class",
        "responsibility": "Draws the repeating linear-gradient grid pattern and animates it along the Y axis with a perspective transform."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (for .vue SFC support)",
      "sass-loader / scss (for <style lang='scss'>)",
      "vue-loader (for parsing template and scoped styles)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Import the component in another Vue file: `import AnimatedGrid from 'modules/landing/components/elements/AnimatedGrid.vue'`, register it, then embed `<AnimatedGrid/>` in the template to display the animated background.",
    "Importance": 2,
    "Notes": [
      "No <script> blockâ€”component has no reactive data or methods.",
      "Styles are scoped to avoid leaking into other components.",
      "Keyframes animation named 'play' handles continuous translateY + rotateX transforms.",
      "Perspective is set on the wrapper to produce 3D grid effect.",
      "Background grid size and speed can be tuned via SCSS variables or props if extended."
