  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Defines the Vue Router route configuration for the \"Notifications\" section of the application, including layout, main page and preferences page routes.",
    "Purpose": "Provide a self-contained route object that can be imported into the root router to handle all `/notifications`-related paths and nested views.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "NotificationsLayout",
        "file": "../components/layouts/NotificationsLayout.vue",
        "responsibility": "Acts as the parent/layout wrapper for all notifications-related child routes."
      },
      {
        "name": "Notifications",
        "file": "../components/pages/Notifications.vue",
        "responsibility": "Renders the main notifications page (list or overview of notifications)."
      },
      {
        "name": "NotificationPreferences",
        "file": "../components/sections/NotificationPreferences.vue",

    ],
    "Usage": "Imported into the application's central router configuration (e.g. `router/index.js`) and merged into the `routes` array so that `/notifications` and its children become active routes.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "The exported constant is misspelled as `nofitications` (typo) but used as the route definition for `/notifications`.",
      "Both child routes have commented-out `requiresAuth` flagsâ€”authentication guards may be enabled in the future.",
      "Each route defines a `meta.title` to drive dynamic document titles or breadcrumb labels."
