  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue single-file component rendering a “Our Focus” section with introductory text and a set of metric cards (farms, strains, monthly yield, dispensaries, tokens). It defines layout, minimal styling, and lifecycle hooks skeleton.",
    "Purpose": "Provide a dedicated landing-page section showcasing key company metrics and a brief introduction to Weeder Farms’ cannabis cultivation expertise.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "SectionFocus",
        "type": "Vue SFC",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Render section wrapper with id “our-focus” and two columns",
          "Display heading, subheading and descriptive paragraph",
          "Render a grid of metric “cards” with counts and labels"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "industry card",
        "type": "DOM element (div.card)",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Display a numeric metric (h3) and label (p)",
          "Receive a ref via setItemRef for potential animations or measurements"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "onMounted",
        "purpose": "Vue lifecycle hook placeholder for code to run after component mounts",
        "parameters": "callback (currently empty)"
      },
      {
        "name": "setItemRef",
        "purpose": "Intended to collect references to each .industry card for later use (e.g., animation)",
        "parameters": "el (DOM element)",
        "notes": "Not implemented in the script; needs definition"
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (reactive, computed, toRefs, ref, onMounted, onUpdated, inject)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported into a parent layout or landing-page module, e.g.:\n\nimport SectionFocus from 'modules/landing/components/sections/SectionFocus.vue'\n\nand used in template as <SectionFocus />.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "The setItemRef function is referenced in template but missing in the script block – likely an oversight.",
      "Imports of computed, reactive, toRefs, ref, onUpdated, inject are unused and can be cleaned up or implemented.",
      "Scoped SCSS applies minimal styling to .industry elements; further styles may be defined globally or via utility classes.",
      "This component appears generic and reusable for any metric-display section but is currently hardcoded with specific values."
