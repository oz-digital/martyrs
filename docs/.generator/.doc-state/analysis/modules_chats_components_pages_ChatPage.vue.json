  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "ChatPage.vue is a wrapper component for the chat interface. It renders a ChatWindow component and manages the chat lifecycle (setting username, connecting/disconnecting WebSocket, and selecting the current chat) via a shared chat store.",
    "Purpose": "Provide the main page layout for a chat session: initialize the chat store on mount with the proper user context and chat ID, render the chat UI, and clean up the connection on unmount.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "ChatPage",
        "responsibility": "Top‐level page component that manages lifecycle hooks and renders the ChatWindow."
      },
      {
        "name": "ChatWindow",
        "responsibility": "Displays the messages, input field, and UI controls for a single chat conversation."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "selectChat",
        "description": "Sets the current chat in the chat store to the given chat ID.",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "chatId",
            "type": "String",
            "description": "Identifier of the chat to select."
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "onMounted callback",
        "description": "Lifecycle hook that runs when the component is mounted. It initializes the username in the store, opens a WebSocket connection for the user, and sets the current chat ID.",
        "parameters": []
      },
      {
        "name": "onUnmounted callback",
        "description": "Lifecycle hook that runs when the component is about to be destroyed. It disconnects from the WebSocket chat.",
        "parameters": []
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      {
        "module": "vue",

        "imports": [
          "chatStore"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Usage": "Typically registered in a route or parent view. It expects three props (username, user, chatID) passed down from the router or a containing component for context, then renders the ChatWindow and handles chat-store interactions.",
    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses Vue 3 Composition API with <script setup> syntax.",
      "selectChat helper is defined but not currently bound to any template event.",
      "No local reactive state is declared; all state is managed via the chatStore.",
      "The <style> block is empty, indicating styling may be inherited or defined elsewhere.",
      "Props naming: 'user' vs 'username' may cause confusion – check consistency with parent components."
