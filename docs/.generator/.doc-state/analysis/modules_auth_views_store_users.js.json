  "extension": ".js",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "This file defines a reactive Vue store module for user data, providing state, CRUD actions, and mutations to manage a list of users and a currently selected user. It wraps HTTP calls to a backend API and integrates global error handling.",
    "Purpose": "Serve as the central store for user-related data and operations within the authentication module of the application—managing retrieval, creation, updating, and deletion of user records.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "state",
        "type": "reactive object",
        "responsibilities": "Holds two pieces of state: 'all' (array of all user objects) and 'current' (detailed object for the currently selected user)."
      },
      {
        "name": "actions",
        "type": "object",
        "responsibilities": "Defines asynchronous CRUD methods (create, read, update, delete) that call the backend via Axios and commit mutations on success or report errors globally."
      },
      {
        "name": "mutations",
        "type": "object",
        "responsibilities": "Provides synchronous methods to change the store: 'set' to assign a value to a state property and 'clean' to reset the 'current' user to an empty template."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "create",
        "params": [
          "user"
        ],
        "description": "Sends a POST to '/api/users' to create a new user, commits the response to state.current, and returns the created user data.",
        "returns": "Promise resolving with the new user object or rejecting with an error."
      },
      {
        "name": "read",
        "params": [
          "options"
        ],
        "description": "Fetches users from '/api/users'. If options._id is provided, commits the first result to state.current; otherwise commits the full list to state.all.",
        "returns": "Promise resolving with the fetched data array."
      },
      {
        "name": "update",
        "params": [
          "user"
        ],
        "description": "Sends a PUT to '/api/users/{user._id}' to update an existing user, commits the updated user to state.current, and returns the updated data.",
        "returns": "Promise resolving with the updated user object."
      },
      {
        "name": "delete",
        "params": [
          "user"
        ],
        "description": "Sends a DELETE to '/api/users/{user._id}', then removes the user from state.all if present.",
        "returns": "Promise resolving on success or rejecting with an error."
      },
      {
        "name": "set",
        "params": [
          "user",
          "property"
        ],
        "description": "Mutation that assigns the provided user data to the given state property ('all' or 'current').",
        "returns": "void"
      },
      {
        "name": "clean",
        "params": [],

      "@martyrs/src/modules/globals/views/store/globals.js"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported into higher-level store aggregators or Vue components via `import { state, actions, mutations } from 'modules/auth/views/store/users.js'` and used with Vue's Composition API or a custom store loader.",
    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses Vue 3 reactive API to track state changes in components.",
      "Global errors from HTTP operations are propagated via setError for centralized display.",
      "The 'clean' mutation resets fields that differ from the initial 'current' template—possible mismatch (e.g., missing profile/socials) indicates a potential inconsistency to review.",
      "Async actions wrap returns in Promise.resolve/Promise.reject which is redundant since async functions already return Promises."
