  "name": "ProfileLikes.vue",
  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "ProfileLikes.vue is a Vue page component that renders a 'Likes' section on a user’s profile. It displays a header, a Tab control to switch between 'My posts' and 'Following', synchronizes the selected tab with the URL query parameter, and conditionally renders a Feed of liked posts.",
    "Purpose": "Provide the UI for browsing a user's liked content (posts or hubs) within the profile section of the application, keeping the current tab in sync with the URL for bookmarking and navigation.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "Tab",
        "responsibility": "Renders a tabbed navigation control, allows selection between 'My posts' and 'Following', and exposes v-model:selected for two-way binding of the active tab."
      },
      {
        "name": "Feed",
        "responsibility": "Displays a feed of items (in this case, the user's liked posts) based on the provided user/owner ID."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "watchTabOrganization",
        "description": "Watches changes to the reactive ref tabOrganization and updates the route’s query parameter 'tab' via router.replace so that the URL stays in sync with the UI.",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "newValue",
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The newly selected tab value ('posts' or 'hubs')."
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, watch)",
      "vue-router (useRoute, useRouter)",
      "@martyrs/src/components/Tab/Tab.vue",
      "@martyrs/src/modules/community/components/sections/Feed.vue"
    ],
    "Usage": "This component is imported into the router configuration (e.g. under a route like '/profile/:_id/likes') and rendered when the user navigates to their Likes page. The route params and query drive its behavior.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses <script setup> syntax for a lean component definition.",
      "Directly mutates route.query.tab to initialize the tab state—while effective, it relies on mutable query objects.",
      "Only the 'posts' tab renders a Feed component; no UI is provided yet for the 'hubs' tab within this template.",
      "No <style> block is defined locally; styling comes from global or parent styles."
