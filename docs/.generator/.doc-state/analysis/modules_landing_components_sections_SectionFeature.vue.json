  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue component rendering a two-column feature section with an image and accompanying text (title and description). It optionally flips column order based on a prop and sets up basic i18n messages for English.",
    "Purpose": "To display a feature block on the landing page, showcasing an image alongside a title and description, with optional ordering control.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "SectionFeature",
        "description": "Root component handling display of image and text in two columns."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "defineProps",
        "description": "Vue composition API helper to define incoming props: image (String), title (String), description (String), order (Boolean).",
        "parameters": [
          "['image','title','description','order']"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "useI18n",
        "description": "Initializes internationalization context with custom messages.",
        "parameters": [
          "{ messages: { en: { ... } } }"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "t",
        "description": "Translation function returned by useI18n; intended to fetch localized strings by key.",
        "parameters": [
          "key (String)"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue",
      "vue-i18n"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported and used in landing page modules or parent layout components. Example: import SectionFeature from 'modules/landing/components/sections/SectionFeature.vue'; then used in template as <SectionFeature :image=\"...\" :title=\"...\" :description=\"...\" :order=\"...\"/>.",
    "Importance": 2,
    "Notes": [
      "Styles are global (not scoped) and only define the .order-2 class.",
      "i18n setup provides English messages but the component currently binds directly to props for title/description instead of using the t() function, suggesting incomplete integration.",
      "Image tag uses loading=\"lazy\" and object-fit-cover utilities for performance and layout.",
      "Utility CSS classes (e.g., o-hidden, pos-relative) likely come from the projectâ€™s design system or the \"martyrs\" framework."
