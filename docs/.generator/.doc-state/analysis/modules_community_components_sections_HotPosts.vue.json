  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue component that renders a horizontal slider of “hot” blog posts, fetching data from the community blog store and displaying each post via a CardBlogpost component.",
    "Purpose": "Provide a reusable UI section in the community module for displaying a customizable, paginated slider of featured or recent blog posts.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "Slider",
        "responsibility": "Wrapper that handles list fetching, pagination and carousel behavior; exposes a default slot for rendering each item."
      },
      {
        "name": "CardBlogpost",
        "responsibility": "Presentation component that displays individual blog post metadata (title, author, preview) in a card format."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "store.read",
        "description": "Asynchronous loader passed to the Slider component to fetch a page of blog posts from the community store.",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "options",
            "type": "Object",
            "description": "Additional paging or filter options (currently unused in the implementation)."
          }
        ],
        "implementation": "blog.read({ skip, limit, user: userId, period, category })"
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, onMounted, defineProps)",
      "@martyrs/src/components/Feed/Feed.vue (imported but unused)",
      "@martyrs/src/components/Slider/Slider.native.vue",
      "@martyrs/src/modules/community/components/blocks/CardBlogpost.vue",
      "@martyrs/src/modules/community/store/blogposts.js",
      "@martyrs/src/modules/auth/views/store/auth.js"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported into parent views or pages (e.g. Community homepage) via `import HotPosts from '.../HotPosts.vue'` and used as `<HotPosts :skip=\"0\" :limit=\"8\" :userId=\"someUserId\" period=\"week\" category=\"featured\" />` to render the slider.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "The component uses the `<script setup>` syntax for concise setup of props and imports.",
      "The Feed import is included but not referenced in template—likely a leftover and can be removed.",
      "Default `userId` prop reads from the auth store at import time; changes in auth.state.user._id after mount will not update this default.",
      "Styles define a responsive slide width: 25% on large screens and 75% on narrower viewports (≤1025px).",
      "Only English locale is provided in the `text` prop for the no-data message."
