    "Summary": "Vue Single File Component that displays a numeric rating and renders up to five star icons, adjusting their opacity based on the rating value. It also shows the total number of reviews.",
    "Purpose": "Provide a reusable UI block for displaying an average rating (1–5) alongside the count of reviews within the organizations module.",
    "Components": [

        "name": "Rating",
        "type": "Vue Component",

      {
        "name": "SVG Star Icon",
        "type": "Inline SVG",
        "responsibility": "Visual representation of a single star; CSS class toggles opacity when the index exceeds the rating."

    "Usage": "Imported into parent components or pages via `import Rating from 'modules/organizations/components/blocks/Rating.vue'`, then used as <Rating :rating=\"value\" :amount=\"count\"/>.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "No style block present; styling is applied via utility CSS classes (e.g., flex, mn-r-small).",
      "The component pre-imports `ref` and `watch` but does not currently utilize them—these imports could be removed or extended later.",
      "Star icons are generated with `v-for` over a hardcoded range of 1 to 5."
