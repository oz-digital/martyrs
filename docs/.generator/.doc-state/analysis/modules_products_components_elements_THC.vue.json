  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue component that renders a THC percentage badge for a product, including dynamic SVG background colors based on the THC value.",
    "Purpose": "Display the product’s THC attribute as a styled badge in product listings or detail views.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "THC",
        "responsibility": "Receive a product object via props, read its attributes[1].value (THC percentage), display the value and the label 'THC', and render one of four SVG polygons colored by threshold."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "defineProps",
        "purpose": "Declare the incoming props for the <script setup> block.",
        "parameters": [
          "{ product: Object }"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Number",
        "purpose": "Convert the string value of product.attributes[1].value to a Number for threshold comparisons in v-if.",
        "parameters": [
          "product.attributes[1].value"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, defineProps)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported as a child component in product‐related views or cards (e.g. `import THC from 'modules/products/components/elements/THC.vue'`) and used in templates by passing a `product` prop.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Relies on product.attributes[1] existing; no fallback if attribute is missing or out of bounds beyond the v-if.",
      "Imports `ref` but does not use it; could be removed to clean up.",
      "SCSS uses CSS variable `--white` for stroke color and includes a media query to scale down on narrower viewports.",
      "Threshold logic is hardcoded; future improvements could refactor it into a computed or helper."
