    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, onMounted, defineProps, defineExpose)",
      "SCSS for .spoiler transition styling"
    ],
    "Usage": "Import the component (`import Spoiler from 'components/Spoiler/Spoiler.vue'`) and use it in templates as `<Spoiler :status=\"initialState\">` with named slots `header` and `content`.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Initial open/closed status can be controlled via the `status` prop.",
      "Uses `v-show` rather than `v-if`, so content remains in the DOM when hidden.",
      "Defines a `showSpoiler` ref in `defineExpose` to allow parent components to read or modify the open state if needed.",
      "Manual reflow (`void el.offsetHeight`) is used to force the browser to register height changes and ensure smooth CSS transitions."
