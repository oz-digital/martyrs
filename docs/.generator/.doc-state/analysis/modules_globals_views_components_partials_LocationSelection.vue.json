  "name": "LocationSelection.vue",
  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue.js component that allows the user to select a geographic location by typing an address or choosing a point on a map. It syncs the selected location (country, state, city, address, coordinates) with a global store and persists it in localStorage.",
    "Purpose": "Serves as a UI partial for location selection in the application’s global module. It is used wherever the app needs to capture or change the user’s delivery or service location.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "LocationSelection",
        "role": "This file’s default export (implicit via <script setup>) that assembles the Address and LocationMarker subcomponents, handles events, and coordinates saving the selection."
      },
      {
        "name": "Address",
        "importFrom": "@martyrs/src/components/Address/Address.vue",
        "role": "Renders an address input/autocomplete field using Google Maps API. Emits updates for country, state, city, address, and location."
      },
      {
        "name": "LocationMarker",
        "importFrom": "@martyrs/src/components/LocationMarker/LocationMarker.vue",
        "role": "Displays a map marker view for the chosen address. Emits the same set of update events to sync back to the parent."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "savePosition",
        "params": [],
        "returns": "void",
        "description": "Copies the local `position` ref into the global store, closes the location popup flag, and writes the position object to localStorage under key 'position'."
      },
      {
        "name": "onMounted callback",
        "params": [],
        "description": "Lifecycle hook that initializes the local `position` ref from `globals.state.position` when the component is mounted."
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, onMounted)",
      "vue-router (useRoute, useRouter)",
      "vue-i18n (useI18n)",
      "@martyrs/src/components/Address/Address.vue",
      "@martyrs/src/components/LocationMarker/LocationMarker.vue",
      "@martyrs/src/modules/globals/views/store/globals.js"
    ],
    "Usage": "Typically imported into a parent view or a modal popup for picking a location. The parent does not need to register any events beyond showing/hiding this component; the component itself handles syncing with the global store.",
    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses `:key=\"$i18n.locale\"` on subcomponents to force remount when locale changes.",
      "Empty `<style lang=\"scss\">` block is a placeholder for future CSS overrides.",
      "Relies on a global mutable store (`globals.state`) rather than Vuex/Pinia, so changes are side-effectful.",
      "No error handling if Google Maps API fails to load.",
      "Localization messages are declared inline and passed to `useI18n`."
