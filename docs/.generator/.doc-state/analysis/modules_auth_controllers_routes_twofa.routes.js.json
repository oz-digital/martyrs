  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Defines two Express routes for sending two-factor authentication (2FA) codes: one for new sign-ups and one for password resets.",
    "Purpose": "Registers HTTP POST endpoints under /api/twofa that invoke middlewares to validate user state and then dispatch a 2FA code via the twofa service.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "default export",
        "type": "function",
        "role": "Accepts an Express `app` instance and a database handle `db`, wires up two 2FA routes with appropriate middleware and controller handlers."
      },
      {
        "name": "middlewareFactory",
        "type": "factory function",
        "role": "Generates middleware object (`verifySignUp`, `verifyUser`) bound to the provided `db`."
      },
      {
        "name": "controllerFactory",
        "type": "factory function",
        "role": "Creates a controller object with a `sendcode` method, bound to the provided `db`."
      }

    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "default exported function",
        "description": "Binds two POST routes to the Express app, wiring middleware and controller handlers.",
        "parameters": [

            "name": "app",

    "Dependencies": [
      {
        "module": "@martyrs/src/modules/auth/controllers/middlewares/index.js",
        "imported": "middlewareFactory",
        "purpose": "Provides user-validation middleware for signup and existing-user checks."
      },
      {
        "module": "../services/twofa.service.js",
        "imported": "controllerFactory",
        "purpose": "Provides the 2FA code sending logic in the form of a controller."
      }
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported and invoked in the central router/bootstrapping code with `app` and `db` arguments. Example: `import twofaRoutes from './modules/auth/controllers/routes/twofa.routes.js'; twofaRoutes(app, db);`",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Reuses the same controller method (`sendcode`) for both signup and password-reset flows, differing only by middleware checks.",
      "Routes are hard-coded under `/api/twofa`; no versioning is applied here.",
      "Relies on the middleware factory to throw or respond early if user state checks fail.",
      "Lightweight file: no direct business logic, purely wiring middleware and controller."
