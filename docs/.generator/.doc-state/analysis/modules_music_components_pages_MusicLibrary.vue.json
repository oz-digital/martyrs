    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "The fetchLibraryData function currently only fetches tracks; fetching for playlists, albums, and artists appears incomplete or deferred.",
      "ArtistList rendering is commented out in favor of the ArtistManager component.",
      "The component uses local refs for user data instead of directly mapping store state, providing isolation but duplicating state management.",
      "No <style> block is present; styling relies entirely on global CSS utility classes.",
      "Tabs are configured via a hard-coded array; adding a new tab requires updating both the array and the template logic."
