  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue 3 component that renders a comments section on a user’s profile page, providing a tabbed interface to switch between the user’s own posts and the hubs they follow, and displays a Feed component for the selected tab.",
    "Purpose": "To display and manage the ‘Comments’ view under a user profile, allowing users to switch between their own posts and followed hubs via tabs and reflect the selection in the URL query parameters.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "Tab",
        "responsibility": "Renders a tab bar with configurable tab labels and model binding for the selected tab."
      },
      {
        "name": "Feed",
        "responsibility": "Displays a feed of items (comments/posts) based on the current user and selected tab context."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "setup (script-setup)",
        "description": "Initializes reactive state, reads route parameters and query, watches for tab changes and updates the router query parameter accordingly.",
        "parameters": [
          "none (uses composition API hooks)"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "watch(tabOrganization, callback)",
        "description": "Observes changes to the tabOrganization ref and performs a router.replace to sync the 'tab' query parameter in the URL.",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "newValue",
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The newly selected tab value ('posts' or 'hubs')."
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, watch, script setup)",
      "vue-router (useRoute, useRouter)",
      "@martyrs/src/components/Tab/Tab.vue",
      "@martyrs/src/modules/community/components/sections/Feed.vue"
    ],
    "Usage": "Typically registered as a route component in the router configuration for a path like '/profile/:_id/comments'. When this component mounts, it reads the current 'tab' query param (or defaults to 'posts') and syncs UI state and URL accordingly.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "No <style> block is present—styling is inherited or provided globally.",
      "The 'hubs' tab is configured but does not conditionally render a Feed; only 'posts' triggers the Feed component. Additional logic may be needed for 'hubs'.",
      "URL synchronization via router.replace ensures the tab state persists on page reload and deep-linking."
