    "Summary": "Vue page component that renders a list of payments. It displays a header with filterable tabs and an action button to create a new payment, and then loads and shows payment items in a feed layout.",
    "Purpose": "Provide a user interface to view, filter, and navigate through wallet payments in the application.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "SectionPageTitle",
        "path": "@martyrs/src/modules/globals/views/components/sections/SectionPageTitle.vue",

      "@martyrs/src/modules/wallet/views/store/payments.store"
    ],
    "Usage": "Registered as a route view in the wallet module. Other parts of the router or parent layouts import this component by its file path (`modules/wallet/views/components/pages/Payments.vue`) to render the payments page.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses SCSS styles scoped to generic utility classes (`.round-stat`, `.order-card`) though some of these classes are not referenced in the template and may be shared or leftover.",
      "The `tab` reactive variable controls filtering by payment status; when set to anything other than 'all', an extra `type` option is passed to the feed store read function.",
      "The Feed component relies on a v-slot to expose `items` and uses a simple `v-for` block to render raw payment objects; in a production build, a dedicated PaymentCard sub‐component might replace the placeholder `{{ payment }}`.",
      "The route parameter `route.params._id` is used as `owner` to scope payments to a specific user or entity."
