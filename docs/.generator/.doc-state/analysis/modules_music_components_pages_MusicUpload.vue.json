  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "A Vue 3 page component that renders a music upload interface. It checks the user’s authentication state: if unauthenticated, it prompts for sign-in; if authenticated, it displays an upload form. Upon successful upload, it navigates to the newly uploaded track’s detail page.",
    "Purpose": "Provides the UI and routing logic for the ‘Upload Music’ page in the music module of the application.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "Button",
        "location": "@martyrs/src/components/Button/Button.vue",
        "responsibility": "Reusable button UI component that supports click handling, loading and success states."
      },
      {
        "name": "UploadForm",
        "location": "../forms/UploadForm.vue",
        "responsibility": "Encapsulates the file selection and upload workflow; emits an `uploaded` event with track metadata upon success."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "onTrackUploaded",
        "description": "Callback invoked when the `UploadForm` emits its `uploaded` event. Navigates to the track-detail route for the newly uploaded track.",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "track",
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "url": "string (used as route parameter)"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref)",
      "vue-router (useRouter, $router, $route)",
      "@martyrs/src/components/Button/Button.vue",
      "../forms/UploadForm.vue",
      "@martyrs/src/modules/auth/views/store/auth.js (state as authState)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Typically registered as a route component in the music module's router config (e.g. path '/upload'). Rendered when users navigate to the Upload Music page.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` syntax for concise Composition API code.",
      "Relies on a global auth store (`authState.access.status`) to gate access to the upload form.",
      "No local CSS; styling is driven by utility classes.",
      "Redirects back to the current path after sign-in via query parameter.",
      "Emits navigation imperatively via `router.push` rather than using `<router-link>`."
