    "Summary": "This file defines a Vue reactive store module for managing music tracks. It provides state properties for various track lists (all, popular, recent, featured, user-specific), loading flags, and the currently selected track. It also exports a set of asynchronous actions to fetch, create, update, and delete tracks via an API endpoint.",
    "Purpose": "Serve as the centralized data layer for music track operations in the application. It abstracts API calls and state management for any component that needs to display or manipulate tracks.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "trackStore",

    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses both the Martyrs `Store` wrapper and native fetch calls; the mix may be consolidated for consistency.",
      "`createTrack` includes advanced error handling and timeout logic to prevent hanging requests.",
      "Reactive `state` ensures Vue components update automatically when data arrives.",
      "Global `setError` is invoked on creation failuresâ€”ensure it's available in the app context.",
      "Environment variable `API_URL` must be defined for all endpoints to work correctly."
