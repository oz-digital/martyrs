    "Purpose": "Acts as the main hero block on the landing page, providing an engaging video backdrop plus dynamically translated text and contact details.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "SectionHeroVideo",
        "role": "Container component for the hero section combining text and video"
      },
      {
        "name": "videoElement (ref)",

      "vue-i18n (useI18n)"

    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "Component uses inline i18n messages; English and Russian locales are defined but Russian lacks some contact keys.",
      "The `<video>` tag has a typo: `playsinlineclass` should probably be `playsinline`.",
      "SCSS includes a mobile breakpoint that reorders columns and applies a gradient overlay on the video.",
      "Video is set to `autoplay muted loop playsinline` for mobile compatibility."
