  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Defines and exports a Vue Router route configuration object for the \"pages\" section of the application: a parent route with an empty layout and a dynamic child route that loads individual Page components asynchronously.",
    "Purpose": "To declare and expose the router definition for all \"pages\" URLs, including metadata for titles and a code-split child component, so that the main router can include it in the application routing tree.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "layoutEmpty",
        "importPath": "@martyrs/src/modules/globals/views/components/layouts/Empty.vue",
        "role": "Wrapper layout component used as the parent shell for all \"pages\" routes."
      },
      {
        "name": "Page",
        "importPath": "../components/pages/Page.vue",
        "role": "Individual page view component, loaded lazily via dynamic import when a matching URL is visited."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "anonymous dynamic import",
        "signature": "() => Promise<Component>",
        "description": "Asynchronously loads the Page.vue component when the child route is accessed. Annotated with webpackChunkName 'Page' for code splitting."
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "@martyrs/src/modules/globals/views/components/layouts/Empty.vue",
      "webpack dynamic import of '../components/pages/Page.vue' (chunkName: 'Page')"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported in the main router index (e.g. `import pages from './router/pages.router'`) and added to the `routes` array so that `/pages` and its child URLs are handled by this configuration.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses a catch-all child path `:url+` to match any nested path under `/pages`.",
      "Meta objects contain localized titles for English ('en') and Russian ('ru').",
      "Dynamic import ensures the Page component is lazy-loaded for performance.",
      "No classes are defined; the file exports a plain object."
