  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "This file defines a reactive store for \"initiatives\" in a Vue application using the Martyrs framework. It maintains state, provides CRUD and approval/rejection actions via Axios calls, and records a history of state changes.",
    "Purpose": "To centralize data management for initiatives: fetching all initiatives, retrieving a single initiative by ID, creating, updating, deleting, approving, and rejecting initiatives, as well as tracking state changes for debugging or undo/redo functionality.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "initiativesState",
        "type": "reactive object",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Hold the list of all initiatives (`all`).",
          "Hold the currently selected initiative (`current`)."
        ]

        "type": "plain object",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Expose asynchronous methods to interact with the `/api/initiatives` endpoints.",
          "Update `initiativesState` based on API responses.",
          "Set global error state on request failures."
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "initiativesHistory",
        "type": "array",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Store snapshots of `initiativesState` over time for history tracking."

      {

        "params": [

        "name": "deleteInitiative",
        "params": [
          "id"

        "description": "Sends a DELETE for the specified initiative, removes it from `initiativesState.all`."

        "name": "approveInitiative",
        "params": [

      "@martyrs/src/modules/globals/views/utils/axios-instance.js ($axios)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported into Vue components or other modules to read/write initiative data. Example: `import { initiativesState, initiativesActions } from 'modules/governance/views/store/initiatives.js';` then call `initiativesActions.getAllInitiatives()` and bind to UI via `initiativesState`.",
    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses `watch` to deep-copy and record each state change into `initiativesHistory`, enabling time-travel debugging or undo functionality.",
      "All actions propagate errors to a global error handler via `setError` and rethrow them, ensuring consistent error reporting.",
      "State shape for `current` initiative is predefined with empty/default fields; components can rely on its structure for form bindings."
