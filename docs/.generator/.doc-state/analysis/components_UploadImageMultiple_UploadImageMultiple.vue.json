  "name": "UploadImageMultiple.vue",
  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue component that provides a drag-and-drop and browse interface for uploading multiple image files. It shows an upload icon and instructions, handles file selection or drop events, uploads files to a server endpoint, displays a loading indicator during upload, and emits the array of uploaded file paths.",
    "Purpose": "Serve as a reusable UI widget in the application for selecting or dropping multiple image files, uploading them to a specified server path, and communicating the resulting file URLs back to parent components.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "UploadImageMultiple",
        "type": "Vue SFC",
        "responsibility": "Encapsulates the template, logic, and styling for the multi-image upload UI."
      },
      {
        "name": "IconUpload",
        "source": "@martyrs/src/modules/icons/navigation/IconUpload.vue",
        "responsibility": "Displays a graphical upload icon inside the drop zone."
      },
      {
        "name": "Loader",
        "source": "@martyrs/src/components/Loader/Loader.vue",
        "responsibility": "Displays a loading spinner overlay while uploads are in progress."
      },
      {
        "name": "PlaceholderImage",
        "source": "@martyrs/src/modules/icons/placeholders/PlaceholderImage.vue",
        "responsibility": "Imported but not currently used in the template; intended as a fallback or placeholder graphic."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "onComponentClick",
        "purpose": "Programmatically triggers the hidden file input click to open the file browser dialog.",
        "parameters": "None"
      },
      {
        "name": "onFileChange",
        "purpose": "Handles the file input change event or synthetic drop event, builds a FormData payload, posts to the upload API, updates the local image list, and emits the new list.",
        "parameters": "e: Event-like object with e.target.files (FileList)"
      },
      {
        "name": "onDrop",
        "purpose": "Handles files dropped onto the component, prevents default browser behavior, and delegates to onFileChange.",
        "parameters": "e: DragEvent"
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, watch, defineProps, defineEmits)",
      "axios",
      "@martyrs/src/components/Loader/Loader.vue",
      "@martyrs/src/modules/icons/navigation/IconUpload.vue",
      "@martyrs/src/modules/icons/placeholders/PlaceholderImage.vue",
      "process.env.API_URL (runtime environment variable)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Import the component and include it in a parent Vue component template. Pass a prop `uploadPath` (string or object) and optionally override `options` and `text`. Listen for the `update:images` event or use `v-model:images` to receive the array of uploaded file paths.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses <script setup> syntax and Composition API refs.",
      "Client-side validation for file type and size is defined in props.options but not enforced in code.",
      "PlaceholderImage is imported but not rendered; consider removing or integrating it.",
      "Constructs an axios instance per upload using process.env.API_URL; may be optimized by using a shared HTTP client.",
      "Props.uploadPath is declared as Object but used as a string in URL encoding."
    ]
