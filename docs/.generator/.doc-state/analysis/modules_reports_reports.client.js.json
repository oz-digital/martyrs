    "Summary": "This file defines and exports the Reports module for the application, providing an initialization function that registers the reports store and placeholder sections for routes and view components.",
    "Purpose": "To encapsulate setup logic for the 'reports' feature: integrating its Vuex-like store slice into the main store and preparing the module for future routing and component registration.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "ModuleReports",
        "responsibility": "Main module object exposing the initialization method and grouping sub-modules (store, router, components)."

    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "initializeReports",

    ],
    "Usage": "Imported via `import ModuleReports from 'modules/reports/reports.client.js'` and initialized in the app bootstrap with `ModuleReports.initialize(app, store, router, options)`.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Routing and view components are currently commented out and meant for future extension.",
      "`storeReports` is namespaced under 'reports' via `store.addStore('reports', storeReports)`.",
      "The default parent route key is `'Home'`, configurable via `options.route`."
