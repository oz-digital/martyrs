  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "This Vue component renders a list of organizations filtered by role (Owner, Member, Follower), provides a tabbed interface to switch between roles, and includes a button to navigate to the Create Organization page.",
    "Purpose": "Acts as the main Organizations page in the application, fetching and displaying organization data via a Feed component and providing navigation controls.",
    "Components": [
      {

    ],
    "Usage": "Typically registered in the Vue Router as the component for the '/organizations' route. Other parts of the app navigate to it via $router.push or link components.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": "There is no dedicated <style> block; styling relies on utility classes. Uses v-memo for list rendering optimization. Conditionally hides the header on a global MOBILE_APP flag. Route query 'tab' stays in sync with the selected tab via a watcher."
