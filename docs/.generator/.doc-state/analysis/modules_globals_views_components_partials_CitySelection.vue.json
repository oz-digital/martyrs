  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue component for selecting a city. It displays the current city, a list of upcoming cities, and a contact link, with support for i18n and emits an event to close its parent popup.",
    "Purpose": "Provides a UI partial for users to choose their city within the application, typically rendered inside a modal or popup.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "CitySelection",
        "role": "Main component that renders the city selection interface and handles close-popup emission."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "closePopup",
        "description": "Emits the 'close-popup' event to notify the parent to close this component's popup.",
        "parameters": []
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (computed, onMounted, defineProps, defineEmits)",
      "vue-router (useRoute, useRouter)",
      "vue-i18n (useI18n)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported wherever a city selection modal is needed. The parent passes `isPopupOpen` and listens for the `close-popup` event. Example: <CitySelection :isPopupOpen=\"open\" @close-popup=\"handleClose\"/>.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Static text and city lists are defined locally in the `text` object passed to useI18n; no dynamic data source.",
      "Imports `computed` and `onMounted` but these are not used in the current implementation.",
      "Simple SCSS rule only sets max-width on the container.",
      "Props and emits follow the Vue 3 <script setup> convention."
