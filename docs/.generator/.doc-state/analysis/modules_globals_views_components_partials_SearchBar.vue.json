  "name": "SearchBar.vue",
  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "SearchBar.vue is a thin wrapper component that renders a responsive BlockSearch component. It toggles the 'collapsible' prop based on viewport width and sets up a minimal i18n context for navigation labels.",
    "Purpose": "Provide a reusable, responsive search bar partial that can collapse on mobile devices and integrate into layouts or pages across the application.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "BlockSearch",
        "responsibility": "Core search UI block. Renders the search input and handles search interactions. Receives a 'collapsible' prop to enable or disable collapsible behavior."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "useI18n",
        "purpose": "Initialize internationalization context with provided messages. Returns translation functions 't' and 'te'.",
        "parameters": [
          "{ messages: { en: { navigation: { â€¦ } } } }"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "window.matchMedia",
        "purpose": "Detect viewport width on the client to determine if the device is mobile (<= 767px).",
        "parameters": [
          "'(max-width: 767px)'"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, computed)",
      "vue-router (useRoute)",
      "vue-i18n (useI18n)",
      "@martyrs/src/modules/globals/views/components/blocks/BlockSearch.vue"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported wherever a search bar is needed in the UI, for example in a header or navigation layout: `import SearchBar from '.../SearchBar.vue'` then used in template as `<SearchBar />`.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "The `useRoute` import is currently unused and can be removed or integrated if route-based logic is needed later.",
      "Server-side rendering (SSR) guard ensures window.matchMedia only runs in the browser.",
      "i18n messages are defined inline and limited to English navigation labels; consider moving to a centralized locale file for consistency."
