    "Purpose": "Serve as a modular section within the landing page to showcase a set of features or steps, using translation data provided by the parent.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "SectionFeatures",
        "description": "Main Vue component that uses the Composition API and vue-i18n to render a section with a heading and a dynamic list of features."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "defineProps",

            "type": "Object",

            "description": "Contains localization messages including `title` and `features` array."

    "Dependencies": [
      "vue",
      "vue-i18n"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported into a parent landing page component and rendered with `<SectionFeatures :content=\"landingContent\"/>`, where `landingContent` is an object containing localized strings under `title` and `features`.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "The root `<section>` has id `howtobuy`, which may not semantically match “features”.",
      "The `<style lang=\"scss\">` block is empty—styling is entirely via utility classes.",
      "Feature items rely on `feature.title` as a unique key; ensure titles are unique in provided data."
