        "responsibilities": [
          "Render an HTML <footer> with icons and counts for views, reactions (likes) and comments.",
          "Bind click handlers to increment/decrement likes.",
          "Reflect current reaction state (liked/unliked) for the logged-in user."

    "Usage": [
      "Import and register in parent Vue component:",
      "<CardFooter :entity=\"post\" :entityType=\"'post'\" :user=\"currentUser\" />",

    ],
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Template references `views` and `commentsCount` but these refs/computeds are not defined—likely should map to `props.entity.numberOfViews` and `props.entity.numberOfComments`.",
      "Style block is empty (SCSS placeholder).",
      "Error alerts are used for unauthenticated access or API failures; consider replacing with a global notification system.",
      "The `type` parameter in deleteReaction is unused—could be removed or extended for other reaction types."
