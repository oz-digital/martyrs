  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue component for rendering a single comment, showing its header, content, reply/toggle actions and recursively rendering any child comments.",
    "Purpose": "Display and manage a discussion comment node within a threaded comment section, including reply form handling, toggling visibility of child comments, and emitting events for replies or loading more comments.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "CardHeader",
        "role": "Renders the comment’s metadata (author, creation date, etc.) as a header"
      },
      {
        "name": "Comment",
        "role": "Recursive component call to render child comments"
      }

    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "shouldBeExpanded",

        "params": [
          "comment (Object)"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "toggleChildren",
        "purpose": "Toggle the isExpanded state to show/hide child comments",
        "params": []
      },
      {
        "name": "submitReply",
        "purpose": "Emit a 'reply' event with current comment _id and replyContent, then clear form",
        "params": []
      },
      {
        "name": "handleReply",
        "purpose": "Re-emit a 'reply' event from a nested Comment child",
        "params": [
          "parentId (String)",
          "content (String)"
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "loadMoreChildren",
        "purpose": "Emit a 'load-more' event to request more child comments",
        "params": []
      },
      {
        "name": "handleLoadMore",
        "purpose": "Re-emit a 'load-more' event from a nested Comment child",
        "params": [
          "commentId (String)",
          "depth (Number)"
        ]

    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, computed, defineProps, defineEmits)",
      "./Comment.vue (self-recursive comment component)",
      "@martyrs/src/modules/globals/views/components/blocks/CardHeader.vue"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported and used wherever a comment thread is rendered. Parent components pass a comment object, target string, and owner identifier. Recursively invoked for each child comment via <Comment :comment=\"...\" :target=\"...\" :owner=\"...\"/>.",
    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "No <style> block present—styles rely on global or parent-level CSS classes",
      "Both 'Cancel' and 'Send' buttons call submitReply; Cancel may need its own handler",
      "Function loadMoreChildren is defined but not bound in template—load-more handling occurs via handleLoadMore",
      "Initial expansion logic (depth % 3 < 2) auto-expands certain nesting levels"
    ]
