  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue 3 presentational component that receives a map of voting options to vote counts and renders them in a simple list under a 'Voting Results' heading.",
    "Purpose": "Display the outcome of a vote in the UI by listing each option alongside its vote tally.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "VotingResult",
        "type": "Vue Component",
        "responsibility": "Render a header and an unordered list of voting options with their corresponding vote counts."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "defineProps",
        "purpose": "Declare and type-check the `results` prop passed into the component.",
        "parameters": {
          "results": {
            "type": "Object",
            "required": true
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported into parent components or views with `import VotingResult from '.../VotingResult.vue'` and used in template as `<VotingResult :results=\"myResultsObject\" />`.",
    "Importance": 2,
    "Notes": "• Uses the `<script setup>` syntax introduced in Vue 3 Composition API.  \n• No dedicated style block—styling must be provided globally or via parent.  \n• Expects `results` to be a simple object where keys are option names and values are numeric vote counts."
