    "Summary": "This file defines and exports a factory function that creates a Mongoose model for product variants. It builds a VariantSchema with fields such as sku, images, name, price, cost, quantity, unit, ingredients and attributes, applies common and ownership plugins, sets up an index, and returns the Variant model.",
    "Purpose": "To centralize the schema definition and model creation for product variants in the 'products' module, ensuring consistency in data structure and attaching shared behaviors (timestamps, ownership) via reusable schema plugins.",
