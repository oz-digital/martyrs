    "Summary": "Vue component displaying a map section with two MapBlock instances: one for the partner pickup location with an embedded Google Map and link, and another announcing upcoming new places. Uses inline internationalized messages for English and Russian.",
    "Purpose": "Provide a visually styled section on the landing/spot page showing the partner location on a map and informing users about new delivery locations.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "MapSection",
        "role": "Wrapper component that lays out the section, title, and two MapBlock children."
      },
      {
        "name": "MapBlock",
        "role": "Reusable block component that renders a map iframe (if URL provided), title, description text, and optional link button."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "t",
        "origin": "useI18n",
        "description": "Translation function. Takes a message key (string) and returns localized HTML/text based on the current locale.",

            "name": "key",
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Dot-notation path into the messages object, e.g. 'map.title' or 'newplaces.description'."
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, computed, onServerPrefetch, onMounted â€“ imported but only useI18n is used)",
      "vue-i18n (useI18n hook for inline localization)",
      "@martyrs/src/modules/landing/components/blocks/MapBlock.vue"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported into a parent landing or spots page and registered as a section. Example: `import MapSection from 'modules/spots/components/sections/MapSection.vue';` then used in template as `<MapSection/>`.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "The script setup imports several Vue hooks (ref, computed, onServerPrefetch, onMounted) but only useI18n and its `t` function are actually used.",
      "All localization messages are inlined in this component for two locales (en, ru).",
      "The first MapBlock passes a `map` URL and a `link`, while the second omits the `map` prop to render only text.",
      "SCSS styles scope to `#map` and adjust layout, border radius, overflow, and responsive gaps between columns."
