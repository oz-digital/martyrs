  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue single‐file component that, on mount, reads a task ID from the route, fetches the corresponding task data from the central store, and renders its details (name, description, status, assignedTo) in the template.",
    "Purpose": "Provides a dedicated page/view in the governance module for displaying the details of a single task identified by route parameter `id`.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "TaskView",
        "role": "Main component that ties together routing, state management, and template rendering for a single task."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "onMounted",
        "purpose": "Vue lifecycle hook that runs after the component is mounted.",
        "parameters": "async callback with no parameters",
        "behavior": "Reads `id` from `route.params`, dispatches `tasksActions.getTaskById(id)`, then assigns the fetched task to local `task` ref."
      },
      {
        "name": "tasksActions.getTaskById",
        "purpose": "Store action that fetches a task by its ID from the backend or other source.",
        "parameters": "id (String or Number)",
        "behavior": "Populates `tasksState.current` with fetched task data."
      }

    "Dependencies": [
      {
        "module": "vue",
        "imports": [
          "onMounted",
          "ref"

          "tasksActions",
          "tasksState"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Usage": "Typically registered in the router under a route like `/governance/tasks/:id`, then rendered when a user navigates to a task detail URL.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses the `<script setup>` syntax for a concise Composition API integration.",
      "No explicit loading or error state handling is implemented; if the fetch fails or is slow, the UI may remain empty.",
      "No `<style>` block—styling must be provided by parent/global styles or via other CSS modules."
