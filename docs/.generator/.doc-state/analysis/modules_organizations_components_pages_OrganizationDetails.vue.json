  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue component that renders a form for viewing or creating an organization. It displays the current organization state, allows selecting a type, editing profile name and description, and submitting the data to create a new organization.",
    "Purpose": "Serves as the Organization Details page in the application, enabling users to configure or create an organization record within the Organizations module.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "Select",
        "responsibility": "Dropdown component for selecting the organization type."
      },
      {
        "name": "Field",
        "responsibility": "Input field component used for entering the organization name and description."

      {
        "name": "Button",
        "responsibility": "Button component that triggers the form submission."
      },
      {
        "name": "Popup",
        "responsibility": "Imported but not currently used; potentially for showing modal dialogs or alerts."
      },
      {
        "name": "Places",
        "responsibility": "Imported section component for managing organization location(s), not currently rendered in the template."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "onSubmit",
        "purpose": "Asynchronously dispatches the create action to the organization store with the current organization data and the authenticated user ID.",
        "parameters": []
      },
      {
        "name": "redirectTo",

    "Usage": "Likely registered as a route component in the organizations module router. Other parts of the app import it by path (`modules/organizations/components/pages/OrganizationDetails.vue`) to display the organization details/create page.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "The `Popup`, `Places` and `inputsValidation` imports are not used in the template or script logic and may be remnants or placeholders for future features.",
      "The `redirectTo` function's navigation call is commented out, so after submission the user is not automatically redirected.",
      "The `<style>` block is empty except for a placeholder selector `#header`.",
      "The template directly binds to `organization.state.current`, indicating reliance on a global or module-scoped reactive state."
