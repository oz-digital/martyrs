  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue SFC that provides a two‐column layout for the user account/configurator section, renders page‐specific child components via <router‐view> with a transition, and offers a logout button.",
    "Purpose": "Acts as the main layout wrapper for all '/account/*' routes, handling navigation tabs (currently simplified to a logout action) and rendering nested pages inside a transition.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "section#account",
        "role": "Top‐level container that applies grid layout and padding."
      },
      {
        "name": "div.menu-tabs",
        "role": "Holds navigation controls (tabs or buttons) for the account section."
      },
      {
        "name": "button (logout)",
        "role": "Triggers the logout flow and redirects to the sign-in page."
      },
      {
        "name": "router‐view + transition + component",
        "role": "Renders the currently active child route inside a 'scaleIn' transition."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "changeTab",
        "params": [
          "tab"
        ],
        "description": "Updates the reactive 'currentTab' state (not currently bound to any UI element)."
      },
      {
        "name": "logout",
        "params": [],
        "description": "Calls the auth store's logout action, then navigates to the 'Sign In' route."
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (reactive, toRefs, computed, onMounted)",
      "vue-router (useRoute, useRouter, <router-view>)",
      "@/store (useStore for auth)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported as the layout component in the router configuration for all '/account' child routes. Wraps child pages and provides a consistent UI shell.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "The <style> block is empty—custom styles likely inherited from global/parent styles or to be added later.",
      "Several role-based tab buttons are commented out, indicating potential admin-only navigation options.",
      "Computed and onMounted are imported but not used; they can be removed unless needed for future logic.",
      "Reactive 'currentTab' state exists but is not currently bound to any visible UI state."
