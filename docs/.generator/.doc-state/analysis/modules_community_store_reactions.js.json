    "Summary": "Defines a Vue 3 reactive store for managing community reactions, including state, async actions for CRUD API calls, local mutations to update reaction data in-place, and history tracking.",
    "Purpose": "Centralize reaction data handling in the community module: fetching, creating, updating, deleting reactions via API and reflecting changes in local state.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "state",
        "description": "A reactive object holding the current list of reactions and any error state."
      },
      {
        "name": "actions",
        "description": "Asynchronous methods that call backend endpoints to read, create, update or delete reactions, update state on success, and handle errors."
      },
      {
        "name": "mutations",
        "description": "Synchronous helper to update an existing entity's reaction list and count when a reaction is added or removed."
      },
      {
        "name": "history",
        "description": "An array capturing snapshots of the state over time for debugging or time-travel purposes."

          "data": "Array or single object representing entities that hold reactions",
          "reaction": "Reaction object to apply",
          "hasReaction": "Boolean indicating whether to add (true) or remove (false) the reaction"

      "vue (reactive, watch)",
      "@martyrs/src/modules/globals/views/store/globals.js (setError)",
      "@martyrs/src/modules/globals/views/utils/axios-instance.js ($axios)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported as `import { actions, mutations, state } from 'modules/community/store/reactions.js'`. Components or other stores call actions to perform API operations and use mutations.handleReactionUpdate to modify in-memory data.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Tracks every state change in a history array via a Vue watch for debugging or time-travel functionality.",
      "Errors are delegated to a global setError handler.",
      "Mutations assume entities have _id, reactions array, numberOfReactions and hasReaction fields."
