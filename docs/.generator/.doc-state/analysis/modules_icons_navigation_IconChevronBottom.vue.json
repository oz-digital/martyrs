    "Purpose": "Provides a reusable navigation icon (chevron down) for use across the application’s UI.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "IconChevronBottom",
        "responsibility": "Render an SVG chevron arrow rotated 90° to point downwards, with customizable fill color."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [],
    "Dependencies": [

    ],
    "Usage": [

    "Importance": 2,
    "Notes": [
      "No <style> section is defined — styling is controlled via the SVG and CSS custom properties.",
      "The default fill prop is set to 'rgb(var(--black)' which appears to be missing a closing parenthesis.",
      "The SVG is rotated by 90 degrees around its center (40,40) to transform a right-pointing chevron into a downward-pointing one.",
      "No methods or computed properties are defined — component is purely presentational."
