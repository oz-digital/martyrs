  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "This file defines and exports a single route configuration object for the Gallery page in a Vue.js application using the Martyrs framework.",
    "Purpose": "To register the `/gallery` route in the application's router, enabling lazy loading of the Gallery view component.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "gallery",
        "type": "RouteConfig",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Provide the route name (`Gallery`).",
          "Set the route path (`/gallery`).",
          "Define route metadata (`title_hide: true`).",
          "Configure dynamic import of the Gallery.vue component."
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "component",
        "signature": "() => Promise<typeof import('*.vue')>",
        "purpose": "Dynamically imports the Gallery.vue component when the route is visited, enabling code splitting.",
        "parameters": "none"
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      {
        "module": "@martyrs/src/modules/gallery/components/pages/Gallery.vue",
        "importType": "dynamic",
        "usage": "The Vue component rendered when `/gallery` is accessed."
      }
    ],
    "Usage": "This router configuration object is typically imported into a central routes array (e.g., in `router/index.js`), where it is merged with other module routes to build the full Vue Router configuration.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses a webpackChunkName comment (`'Gallery'`) to name the generated code-split chunk.",
      "The `meta.title_hide` flag likely controls layout behavior such as hiding the page title in the UI.",
      "No additional guards or children routes are defined here; this is a leaf route."
