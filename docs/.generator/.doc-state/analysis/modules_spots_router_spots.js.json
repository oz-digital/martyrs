    "Summary": "This file defines the route configuration for the \"spots\" section of a Vue.js application using the Martyrs framework. It sets up nested routes for listing spots by country, state, and city, as well as routes for creating, viewing, and editing individual spots.",
    "Purpose": "To centralize and export the Vue Router definition for all \"spots\"-related paths, including layout components, metadata (titles, themes, breadcrumbs), dynamic imports of page components, and authentication guards.",
    "Components": [

        "name": "layoutEmpty",

    ],
    "Usage": "Imported into the main router index (e.g., in src/router/index.js or a modules aggregator) and added to the routes array to enable navigation to all spots-related pages.",
    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses optional route parameters (country, state, city) to build a nested drill-down UI in a single route tree.",
      "Metadata fields define multilingual titles and theming for headers/footers.",
      "Breadcrumbs are hidden at the top level to streamline the navigation experience.",
      "Webpack chunk names are provided for code-splitting and grouping spot-related resources.",
      "Authentication guard is applied only to creation, detail, and edit routes, not to the public listing."
