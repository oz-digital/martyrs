  "type": "source",
  "name": "Button.vue",
  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue button component that handles asynchronous submit actions, displays loading, success, and error states, supports optional callbacks and counter badges, and applies transition animations and scoped styles.",
    "Purpose": "Provides a reusable, styled button with built-in async behavior (submit, loader, success/error feedback), configurable via props, for use throughout the project UI.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "Button",
        "role": "Primary exported component that renders a <button> element, manages click handling, state transitions, and displays content based on loading/success/error states."
      },
      {
        "name": "Loader",
        "role": "Child component imported from @martyrs/src/components/Loader/Loader.vue, used to render a loading spinner when the submit action is in progress."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "Submit",
        "description": "Main click handler. Disables the button, resets error state, shows loader, calls props.submit(), then on success swaps styles, shows a success indicator, resets after a delay, and optionally invokes props.callback(). On error emits an 'error' event, updates styles and error message, then resets after a timeout.",
        "params": []
      },
      {
        "name": "resetButton",
        "description": "Internal helper to restore the button to its default interactive state: re-enable pointer events, hide loader and success flags, and clear any error."
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, defineProps, defineEmits)",
      "@martyrs/src/components/Loader/Loader.vue"
    ],
    "Usage": "Import and register the component: import Button from 'components/Button/Button.vue'; then use in templates: <Button :submit=\"onSubmit\" :text=\"customText\" :counter=\"count\" /> or with default behaviors.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses <transition name=\"FromTop\"> for smooth content changes between loading, success, and error states.",
      "Props include default async functions for submit and callback to avoid undefined calls.",
      "Direct DOM style/class manipulation is used to swap background colors and pointer events.",
      "The 'text' prop default merges passed textComponent.text with success/error symbols.",
      "Disabled state styling is applied via a scoped SCSS rule for button[disabled]."
