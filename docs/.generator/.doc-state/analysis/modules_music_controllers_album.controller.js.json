  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Defines an AlbumController that extends generic MusicController to handle album-specific API endpoints, including fetching tracks for a given album and retrieving featured albums with caching and access control.",
    "Purpose": "Provide RESTful handlers for album resources in the music module: basic CRUD (inherited) plus custom endpoints for album tracks and featured albums.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "AlbumController",
        "type": "class",
        "extends": "MusicController",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Initialize standard CRUD routes for /api/albums",
          "Implement getAlbumTracks(req, res)",
          "Implement getFeaturedAlbums(req, res)"
        ]
      }

    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "getAlbumTracks",
        "parameters": [
          "req",
          "res"
        ],
        "description": "Validate album existence and access, then return its published tracks sorted by release date.",
        "keySteps": [
          "Fetch album by ID from db.album",
          "Check ABAC permissions and public flag",
          "Query db.track for published tracks of that album",
          "Return JSON array of tracks or error status"

        ],
        "description": "Retrieve up to 10 featured, public albums with track counts, using in-memory cache to reduce DB load.",
        "keySteps": [
          "Check cache for 'featured-albums'",
          "If missing, aggregate db.album with lookup on db.track, size, filtering and sorting",
          "Store result in cache for 1 hour",
          "Return JSON array of featured albums or error status"
        ]

      }
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported via `import albumControllerFactory from './album.controller.js'` then invoked with (app, db) to get route handlers. Handlers are bound methods that you plug into your Express router, e.g. `app.get('/api/albums/:albumId/tracks', controllers.getAlbumTracks)`.",
    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "Relies on parent MusicController to supply generic CRUD and shared utilities (abac, cache, logger).",
      "Custom endpoints enforce ABAC and public flag logic.",
      "getFeaturedAlbums uses MongoDB aggregation pipeline; watch performance on large collections.",
      "Cache key is static — invalidation not handled in this file.",
      "Constructor passes only `app` but super expects (basePath, app, db, model) – ensure correct signature when instantiating."
