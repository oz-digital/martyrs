  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Defines a reactive state, CRUD actions and a mutation handler for organization memberships. It wraps axios calls to a REST API, manages error handling via a global setter, and tracks state history.",
    "Purpose": "Manage membership data within the organizations module: fetch, create, update, delete memberships from the backend, update related entities in-place, and maintain a reactive state for UI components.",
    "Components": [

          "Holds current list of memberships",

          "Call the API via axios",
          "Reset error on success and propagate data",
          "On failure, delegate to global setError and reject"

        "name": "mutations",
        "type": "object",
        "responsibilities": [
          "handleMembershipUpdate: merge single or array payload into an entity",

    ],
    "Usage": "Imported as a store module: `import { state, actions, mutations } from 'modules/organizations/store/memberships.js'`. UI components or other modules call `actions.read()` etc. and bind to `state.memberships`.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses a dedicated axios instance with baseURL from env and credentials enabled.",
      "Global error handling via setError propagates errors to a central error store or UI.",
      "Keeps a history of state snapshots; may grow unbounded if not pruned.",
      "Includes console.log debugging in the mutation â€“ consider removing in production."
