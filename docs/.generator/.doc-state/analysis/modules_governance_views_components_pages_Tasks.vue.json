  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue page component that, on mount, fetches a list of tasks from the store and renders them as CardTaskItem blocks.",
    "Purpose": "Provide a user interface for displaying all governance-related tasks in a list format within the application.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "Tasks.vue",
        "role": "Page-level component coordinating data fetch and rendering of task items."
      },
      {
        "name": "CardTaskItem",
        "role": "Presentational component responsible for displaying a single task’s details."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "onMounted callback",
        "description": "Lifecycle hook that triggers fetching of all tasks when the component is mounted.",

      "../../store/tasks (tasksActions, tasksState)",
      "../blocks/CardTaskItem.vue"
    ],

    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "No local <style> section—styling is inherited or defined globally.",
      "Relies on a centralized store (tasksState) for reactive data binding.",
      "Error handling for the async fetch is not implemented here and should be managed at a higher level or within the action."
