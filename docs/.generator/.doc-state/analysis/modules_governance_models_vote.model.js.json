    "Summary": "Defines and exports a Mongoose model for a Vote entity with fields for value, voter, and voting context, including automatic timestamping.",
    "Purpose": "Provides the schema and model definition for votes in the governance/voting module of the application, enabling CRUD operations on vote records.",

      {
        "name": "VoteSchema",
        "type": "Mongoose.Schema",
        "responsibility": "Describes the structure of a vote document: a numeric value, a reference to a User, a reference to a Voting session, plus automatic createdAt/updatedAt timestamps."
      },
      {
        "name": "Vote",
        "type": "Mongoose.Model",
        "responsibility": "The compiled Mongoose model based on VoteSchema, used to interact with the votes collection in MongoDB."

      "db.mongoose.model",
      "User model (via ref: 'User')",
      "Voting model (via ref: 'Voting')"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported by passing in the database context object: const Vote = require('modules/governance/models/vote.model')(db); Then used to perform queries like Vote.find(), Vote.create(), etc.",
    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses mongoose timestamps with a custom currentTime function for consistency.",
      "Defines required references to User and Voting, enforcing relational integrity at the application level.",
      "The default export pattern allows late-bound initialization after database connection is established."
