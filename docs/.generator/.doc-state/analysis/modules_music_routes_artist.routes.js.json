    "Notes": [
      "The parameters `origins` and `publicPath` are accepted but not used in this file.",
      "Most routes delegate to methods on the artist controller, but the URL-based lookup is implemented inline, bypassing the controller layer.",
      "JWT verification middleware is applied selectively: create, update, delete require authentication; verify requires both authentication and admin role.",
      "Standardized path prefix `/api/artists` is used throughout."
