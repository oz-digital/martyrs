  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "CardHeader.vue is a Vue component that renders the header section of a card-like UI element. It displays the ownerâ€™s avatar or placeholder, name, creator information, time elapsed since creation, formatted date, a stack of participant photos, and an actions dropdown including reporting functionality.",
    "Purpose": "To provide a reusable header block for various entities (posts, events, organizations, etc.) across the application, centralizing display of ownership, authorship, timing, membership and contextual actions.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "Tooltip": "Wraps and displays a hoverable tooltip for the full formatted date when showing elapsed time."
      },
      {
        "Dropdown": "Provides a right-aligned contextual menu for actions such as reporting or custom entity actions."
      },
      {
        "PlaceholderUserpic": "Renders a default user avatar when the owner has no profile photo."
      },
      {
        "PlaceholderOrganizationPic": "Renders a default organization avatar when the owner has no profile photo."
      },
      {
        "IconEllipsis": "Ellipsis icon used as the label trigger for the Dropdown."
      },
      {
        "FormReport": "Embeds a reporting form to file a complaint against the entity."
      },
      {
        "PhotoStack": "Displays a stack of participant avatars based on a list of photos."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "getTimeElapsed",
        "purpose": "Calculate and return a human-readable string indicating how much time has passed since a given timestamp (e.g. '5 days ago').",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "timestamp",
            "type": "String | Number | Date",
            "description": "The creation date/time of the entity."

    "Usage": "Imported into parent Vue views or components that render an entity card. Typically used as <CardHeader :owner=\"...\" :creator=\"...\" :date=\"...\" :actions=\"[...]\" /> to display consistent headers across modules.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Supports a 'short' type mode that hides avatar, name, participants and actions for compact displays.",
      "Uses optional chaining heavily to guard against missing profile or creator data.",
      "Navigates to user or organization profile on avatar/name click via vue-router.",
      "Actions dropdown conditionally shows report form for other users and arbitrary links or methods passed in props.",
      "No scoped or additional styling defined; relies on global utility classes for layout."
