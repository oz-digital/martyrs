  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue 3 functional component that renders a stylized section title using a prop-driven text value.",
    "Purpose": "Provide a reusable header/title section for pages or sub-sections in the martyrs-based application.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "Title.vue",
        "role": "Renders an H2 headline wrapped in semantic HTML and CSS utility classes."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (ref, toRefs, defineProps)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported wherever a section title is needed. Example: import Title from '@/modules/globals/views/components/sections/Title.vue'; then used in template as <Title text=\"Your Heading\" />.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses the <script setup> syntax introduced in Vue 3 for concise component definitions.",
      "No dedicated <style> block; relies on global or utility CSS classes (e.g., w-100, text-fade-in).",
      "Default prop value is 'Dreamy Moments Captured'.",
      "Props are converted to refs via toRefs for reactivity in the template."
