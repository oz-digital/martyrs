  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Vue 3 single-file component that renders a hero section for AI-powered product recommendations. It displays a title, description, an interactive input field (FieldBig) for free-form mood queries, and preset mood buttons. Upon user action it navigates to a recommendation page with the chosen mood query.",
    "Purpose": "Serve as the landing hero on the products page, collecting user input or preset mood selections and routing to the product recommendation flow powered by the AI budtender.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "FieldBig",
        "role": "Custom input component with typing animation, placeholder, and action button. Binds to a reactive `mood` and emits `action` and `update:input`."
      },
      {
        "name": "Shader",
        "role": "Optional background shader component (currently commented out) for visual effect."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "submitMood",
        "description": "Async helper that takes a mood (either from the preset or the free-form input) and dispatches it to the products store.",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "presetMood",
            "type": "string|null",
            "description": "If provided, uses this value; otherwise uses the current `mood.value`."
          }

    "Dependencies": [

    ],
    "Usage": "Imported into a parent page or layout (e.g. ProductsLanding) as `<HeroRecommendation />`. The component registers its own router navigation to the route named 'Product Recommmendation' with a `mood` query parameter.",
    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "Translation payload (`text`) is provided inline to `useI18n`; keys include titles, descriptions, placeholders and preset labels for 'en' and 'ru'.",
      "Route name contains a typo ('Product Recommmendation')â€”must match router configuration exactly.",
      "The `submitMood` function is defined but not used in the template; navigation is done inline via `router.push`.",
      "The Shader and spiral background code are commented out; may be reactivated for additional visual effect.",
      "The component uses scoped styles only for the `.spiral` animation, which is not currently rendered."
