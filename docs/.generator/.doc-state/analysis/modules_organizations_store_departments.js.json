    "Summary": "This file defines a reactive Vue store module for managing department data in an organization. It maintains department list and single department state, provides CRUD actions via Axios calls to a backend API, tracks errors, and records state history.",
    "Purpose": "To centralize and expose department-related state and actions (read, readOne, create, update, delete) for use in Vue components across the Organizations module of the Martyrs project.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "state",
        "type": "reactive object",
        "responsibility": "Holds the departments array, a single department object, and any error. All fields mirror the API schema including access rights."

        "name": "actions",
        "type": "object of async methods",
        "responsibility": "Defines asynchronous CRUD operations against the `/api/departments` endpoints, updates `state`, and delegates error handling to `setError`."
      },

    ],
    "Usage": "Imported by Vue components or higher-level store index files as `import { state, actions } from 'modules/organizations/store/departments.js'`. Components call `actions.read()`, `actions.readOne(id)`, etc., and bind to `state.departments` or `state.department`.",
    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "A `history` array collects every new state snapshot; over time it may grow large unless pruned.",
      "Errors from API calls are funneled through a global `setError` handler for centralized error display.",
      "The department schema includes nested `accesses` flags to control feature-level permissions.",
      "All actions clear previous errors on success, ensuring UI error indicators reset appropriately."
