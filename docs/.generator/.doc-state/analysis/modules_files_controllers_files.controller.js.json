  "extension": ".js",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Defines a factory function that produces a controller for handling multiple file uploads, converting file paths to relative form and returning upload responses.",
    "Purpose": "Offer a reusable upload controller in the 'files' module to process and respond to multiple file uploads within the project.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "controllerFactory",
        "description": "A higher‐order function that accepts injected dependencies (db, publicPath) and returns controller methods."
      },
      {
        "name": "uploadMultipleFileController",
        "description": "An asynchronous Express‐style handler that validates uploaded files, normalizes their paths, and sends a JSON response."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "uploadMultipleFileController",
        "params": [
          "req",
          "res",
          "next"
        ],
        "description": "Main upload handler. Checks for files in req.files, normalizes each path, logs them, and sends a success or error response."
      },
      {
        "name": "convertToRelativePath",
        "params": [
          "absolutePath"
        ],
        "description": "Helper that ensures a leading slash on a file path string, returning a relative path."
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      "db (injected database instance)",
      "publicPath (injected base path for serving files)",
      "Express request (req) and response (res) objects",
      "File upload middleware populating req.files",
      "console for logging"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported as the default export, invoked with (db, publicPath) to retrieve controllers. Typically used in route definitions, e.g.: router.post('/upload', filesController.uploadMultipleFileController).",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Injected parameters db and publicPath are declared but not currently utilized inside the controller.",
      "The code maps req.files entries directly; if req.files contains file objects, path extraction may need adjustment.",
      "Basic error handling returns HTTP 400 for missing files and 500 on processing errors."
