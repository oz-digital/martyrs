  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "Defines the client-side routing configuration for the \"categories\" section of the products module, including list, add, and edit category pages with their paths, metadata, and guards.",
    "Purpose": "To register and export an array of route definitions that the Vue router (or martyrs router) can use to navigate to and render category-related pages in the application.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "Categories.vue",
        "role": "Renders the list of all product categories."
      },
      {
        "name": "CategoryEdit.vue",
        "role": "Used for both adding a new category and editing an existing one."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "component() => import(...)",
        "description": "Asynchronous loader function for code-splitting. Dynamically imports the corresponding Vue page component when the route is accessed.",
        "parameters": []
      },
      {
        "name": "validationAuth.requiresAuth",
        "description": "Navigation guard middleware that ensures the user is authenticated before entering the edit-category route.",
        "parameters": [
          "to",
          "from",
          "next"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      {
        "module": "@martyrs/src/modules/auth/views/middlewares/auth.validation.js",
        "imported": "validationAuth (namespace)",
        "reason": "Uses validationAuth.requiresAuth as a beforeEnter guard"
      },
      {
        "module": "@martyrs/src/modules/products/components/pages/Categories.vue",
        "imported": "via dynamic import in component loader",
        "reason": "View component for listing categories"
      },
      {
        "module": "@martyrs/src/modules/products/components/pages/CategoryEdit.vue",
        "imported": "via dynamic import in component loader",
        "reason": "View component for adding or editing a category"
      }
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported into the main router configuration (e.g. in `router/index.js` or equivalent) where the array is spread or concatenated into the global routes definition. Example: `import categoriesRoutes from './modules/products/router/categories.router.js';` then `routes.push(...categoriesRoutes)`.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "The `beforeEnter` guard is only applied to the edit route, enforcing authentication.",
      "All routes include localized titles in English and Russian under `meta.title` for use in page headers or breadcrumbs.",
      "Dynamic imports enable lazy-loading of the category pages to optimize bundle size.",
      "The `name` field in each route is unique and used for programmatic navigation."
