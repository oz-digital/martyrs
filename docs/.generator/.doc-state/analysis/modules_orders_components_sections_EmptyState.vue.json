  "name": "EmptyState.vue",
  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "A minimalist Vue component that renders a message stating the user has no positions in their order.",
    "Purpose": "Serves as an empty-state placeholder in the orders UI when an order has zero line items.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "EmptyState",
        "type": "Vue SFC (script setup)",
        "responsibilities": [
          "Accepts an `order` prop (not directly used in template)",
          "Renders a static message when there are no order positions"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [],
    "Dependencies": [
      "vue (defineProps API)"
    ],
    "Usage": "Imported into a parent orders component or section. Typically used as:\n\n  ```html\n  <EmptyState :order=\"currentOrder\" />\n  ```\n\nRendered conditionally when `currentOrder.positions.length === 0`.",
    "Importance": 2,
    "Notes": [
      "No internal logic or styling defined; purely presentational.",
      "The `order` prop is declared but not yet used in the template—potential extension point.",
      "Empty `<style>` block indicates styling is handled elsewhere or not required.",
      "Minor text typo: \"You dont\" should be \"You don’t\" or \"You don’t have any positions in your order.\""
