    "Summary": "This file defines and exports the Governance client module for the application. It provides an initialization function that registers data stores for initiatives, tasks, votings, and votes, and mounts the governance-specific routes into the provided router.",
    "Purpose": "Acts as the entry point for the Governance feature on the client side. It wires up state stores and routes so that the main application (app, store, router) can bootstrap governance-related views and data.",
    "Components": [

        "description": "Registers a governance route (default 'Home') with the router, and adds four state stores ('initiatives', 'tasks', 'votings', 'votes') to the store instance. Uses createGovernanceRoutes to build the route definitions."

    "Usage": "import ModuleGovernance from 'modules/governance/governance.client.js';\nModuleGovernance.initialize(app, store, router, { route: 'GovernanceHome' });",
    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": "- The file currently comments out component imports under views. These can be enabled as the UI components are implemented.\n- Default route is 'Home'; can be overridden via options.route.\n- Assumes the store API provides addStore(name, module) and router API provides addRoute(path, routes)."
