    "Importance": 4,
    "Notes": [
      "The `allowedOrigins` parameter is accepted but not used inside this file—potentially for future CORS logic.",
      "Uses POST for the update route instead of the more REST-conventional PUT/PATCH.",
      "Endpoint pluralization is slightly inconsistent (e.g. `/api/products/...` vs `/api/product/recommended`).",
      "Controller methods must adhere to Express middleware signature (req, res, next)."
