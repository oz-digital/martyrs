    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "The `documents` array is declared as a plain JS variable, so it is not reactive—changes won’t trigger updates unless wrapped in ref/reactive.",
      "The Popup component is imported as `Select` by mistake but used as <Popup> in template; likely a naming typo.",
      "Props definition is commented out; currently the component uses its own hard-coded documents list instead of receiving it from parent.",
      "The watchEffect has no body logic tied to a reactive source—could be removed or extended.",
      "Two functions (handleFileUpload, onSubmit) and one import (Button) are unused in the current template."
