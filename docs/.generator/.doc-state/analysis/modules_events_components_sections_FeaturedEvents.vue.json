    "Summary": "Vue SFC that renders two side-by-side lists of events (Planned and Finished) for the authenticated user.",
    "Purpose": "Provide a featured-events section in the UI, splitting the user's events by their phase ('planned' vs. 'finished').",
    "Components": [

        "name": "List",
        "importPath": "@martyrs/src/modules/events/components/sections/List.vue",
        "responsibility": "Fetches and displays a list of events for a given user ID and phase."

    "Usage": "Imported and dropped into any parent or page component that needs to show featured events. Example: `import FeaturedEvents from '.../FeaturedEvents.vue'` then `<FeaturedEvents/>`.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "Uses `<script setup>` syntax; no explicit export default needed.",
      "Accesses `auth.state.user._id` to pass down to the List component.",
      "Imports `events` store but does not reference it directly—likely used internally by the List component.",
      "Responsive SCSS: uses CSS Grid for desktop (≥768px) and horizontal snap-scroll for mobile (<768px).",
      "Several Vue APIs (computed, onMounted, watch, route, router) are imported but not used in this file."
