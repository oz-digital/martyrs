  "extension": ".vue",
  "analysis": {
    "Summary": "BackofficeReports.vue is a Vue 3 single-file component that fetches a list of reports from a Vuex-style store and renders them in a responsive grid. Each report displays user, type, and reason, with buttons for closing or hiding content.",
    "Purpose": "Provide a back-office interface to view and act on user reports within the admin section of the application.",
    "Components": [
      {
        "name": "BackofficeReports",
        "role": "Main page component that handles fetching, displaying, and interacting with reports."
      }
    ],
    "Functions": [
      {
        "name": "deleteReport",
        "description": "Asynchronous helper that calls the store action to remove a report by its ID and logs errors.",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "id",
            "type": "String | Number",
            "description": "The unique identifier of the report to delete."
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Dependencies": [
      {
        "module": "vue",
        "imports": [
          "ref"
        ]
      },
      {
        "module": "../../store/reports",
        "imports": [
          "actions as reportActions",
          "state"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Usage": "This component is typically registered in a router under an admin/backoffice route or imported into a parent component to display the reports dashboard.",
    "Importance": 3,
    "Notes": [
      "The <template> uses placeholder properties (user, type, reason) which should match the real report schema.",
      "There is no <style> block â€“ styling comes from global or utility CSS classes.",
      "Action buttons have no click handlers wired up; you may want to call deleteReport or other actions on click.",
      "On mount the component calls reportActions.read() to populate state.all.",
      "Error handling and user notifications are left as TODOs in the script."
