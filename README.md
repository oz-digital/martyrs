# Martyrs – Framework for Isomorphic Applications

Martyrs is a framework for developing isomorphic applications that can run on any platform with a single codebase. It provides tools for creating both simple and complex applications, styling them, and compiling them for different platforms. With Martyrs, you can develop applications that easily adapt to various devices and environments while maintaining high performance and development convenience.

We believe in the power of a single codebase for all platforms. Our mission is to empower developers to create applications that work everywhere, from the web to mobile devices, without sacrificing quality or performance. This approach offers significant strategic benefits, reduces costs, and simplifies both development and maintenance.

⚠️ **WARNING**: This framework is under active development. Expect changes in the module structure. Use only if you're prepared to contribute. Use at your own risk. ⚠️
